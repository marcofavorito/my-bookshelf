abstract: Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of automated
  sequential decision making, and has been addressed by researchers in many different
  fields, including AI planning, decision analysis, operations research, control theory
  and economics. While the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often
  differ in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers in
  these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyzed using
  the techniques of decision theory. This paper presents an overview and synthesis
  of MDP-related methods, showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling
  many classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes structural properties
  of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular classes of problems, can be exploited
  in the construction of optimal or approximately optimal policies or plans. Planning
  problems commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to describe
  performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state transitions and observations,
  and in the relationships among features used to describe states, actions, rewards,
  and observations. Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these representations,
  can achieve computational leverage by exploiting these various forms of structure.
  Certain AI techniques -- in particular those based on the use of structured, intensional
  representations -- can be viewed in this way. This paper surveys several types of
  representations for both classical and decision-theoretic planning problems, and
  planning algorithms that exploit these representations in a number of different
  ways to ease the computational burden of constructing policies or plans. It focuses
  primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques based on AI-style
  representations.
