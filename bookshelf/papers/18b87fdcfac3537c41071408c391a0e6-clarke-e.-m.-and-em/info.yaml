abstract: We give an efficient procedure for verifying that a finite-state concurrent
  system meets a specification expressed in a (propositional, branching-time) temporal
  logic. Our algorithm has complexity linear in both the size of the specification
  and the size of the global state graph for the concurrent system. We also show how
  this approach can be adapted to handle fairness. We argue that our technique can
  provide a practical alternative to manual proof construction or use of a mechanical
  theorem prover for verifying many finite-state concurrent systems. Experimental
  results show that state machines with several hundred states can be checked in a
  matter of seconds.
