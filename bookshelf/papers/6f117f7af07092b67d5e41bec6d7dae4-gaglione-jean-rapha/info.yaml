abstract: We address the problem of inferring descriptions of system behavior using
  Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) from a finite set of positive and negative examples.
  Most of the existing approaches for solving such a task rely on predefined templates
  for guiding the structure of the inferred formula. The approaches that can infer
  arbitrary LTL formulas, on the other hand, are not robust to noise in the data.
  To alleviate such limitations, we devise two algorithms for inferring concise LTL
  formulas even in the presence of noise. Our first algorithm infers minimal LTL formulas
  by reducing the inference problem to a problem in maximum satisfiability and then
  using off-the-shelf MaxSAT solvers to find a solution. To the best of our knowledge,
  we are the first to incorporate the usage of MaxSAT solvers for inferring formulas
  in LTL. Our second learning algorithm relies on the first algorithm to derive a
  decision tree over LTL formulas based on a decision tree learning algorithm. We
  have implemented both our algorithms and verified that our algorithms are efficient
  in extracting concise LTL descriptions even in the presence of noise.
