abstract: 'Agent-based modeling has been around for decades, and applied widely across
  the social and natural sciences. The scope of this research method is now poised
  to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new affordances provided by Large Language
  Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are not just classic Agent-Based
  Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather, GABMs are constructed
  using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act "reasonably", recall common
  semantic knowledge, produce API calls to control digital technologies like apps,
  and communicate both within the simulation and to researchers viewing it from the
  outside. Here we present Concordia, a library to facilitate constructing and working
  with GABMs. Concordia makes it easy to construct language-mediated simulations of
  physically- or digitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents produce their behavior
  using a flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental operations:
  LLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the Game Master
  (GM), which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsible for simulating
  the environment where the agents interact. Agents take actions by describing what
  they want to do in natural language. The GM then translates their actions into appropriate
  implementations. In a simulated physical world, the GM checks the physical plausibility
  of agent actions and describes their effects. In digital environments simulating
  technologies such as apps and services, the GM may handle API calls to integrate
  with external tools such as general AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital
  apps (e.g., Calendar, Email, Search, etc.). Concordia was designed to support a
  wide array of applications both in scientific research and for evaluating performance
  of real digital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.'
