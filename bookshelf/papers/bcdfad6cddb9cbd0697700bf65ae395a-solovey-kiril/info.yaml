abstract: This is a chapter in the Encyclopedia of Robotics. It is devoted to the
  study of complexity of complete (or exact) algorithms for robot motion planning.
  The term ``complete'' indicates that an approach is guaranteed to find the correct
  solution (a motion path or trajectory in our setting), or to report that none exists
  otherwise (in case that for instance, no feasible path exists). Complexity theory
  is a fundamental tool in computer science for analyzing the performance of algorithms,
  in terms of the amount of resources they require. (While complexity can express
  different quantities such as space and communication effort, our focus in this chapter
  is on time complexity.) Moreover, complexity theory helps to identify ``hard'' problems
  which require excessive amount of computation time to solve. In the context of motion
  planning, complexity theory can come in handy in various ways, some of which are
  illustrated here.
