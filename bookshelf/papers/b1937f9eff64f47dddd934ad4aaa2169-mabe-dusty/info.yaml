abstract: getopt is extremely useful for quickly being able to add options and arguments
  to your program without having to worry much about the parsing yourself. There are
  getopt libraries for many languages but what about BASH? It turns out there are
  actually two versions of getopt that you can use in your BASH scripts; a command
  line utility getopt provided by the util-linux package, and a bash builtin getopts.
  I have provided a brief overview of each in the following sections.
