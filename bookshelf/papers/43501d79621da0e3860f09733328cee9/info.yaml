abstract: 'Update (March 19 2010): this article was updated for LLVM 2.6 thanks to
  a great patch by John Harrison. He rocks! I’ve always been interested in compilers
  and languages, but interest only gets you so far. A lot of the concepts of compiler
  design can easily go way over most programmers’ heads, even the intelligent ones.
  Needless to say, I’ve tried, without much success, to write a small toy language/compiler
  before.'
