abstract: We present the Temporal Logic Synthesis Format (TLSF), a high-level format
  to describe synthesis problems via Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The format builds
  upon standard LTL, but additionally allows to use high-level constructs, such as
  sets and functions, to provide a compact and human-readable representation. Furthermore,
  the format allows to identify parameters of a specification such that a single description
  can be used to define a family of problems. Additionally, we present a tool to automatically
  translate the format into plain LTL, which then can be used for synthesis by a solver.
  The tool also allows to adjust parameters of the specification and to apply standard
  transformations on the resulting formula.
