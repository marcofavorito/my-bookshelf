abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) refers to the practice, in videogames
  and other games, of generating content such as levels, quests, or characters algorithmically.
  Motivated by the need to make games replayable, as well as to reduce authoring burden,
  limit storage space requirements, and enable particular aesthetics, a large number
  of PCG methods have been devised by game developers. Additionally, researchers have
  explored adapting methods from machine learning, optimization, and constraint solving
  to PCG problems. Games have been widely used in AI research since the inception
  of the field, and in recent years have been used to develop and benchmark new machine
  learning algorithms. Through this practice, it has become more apparent that these
  algorithms are susceptible to overfitting. Often, an algorithm will not learn a
  general policy, but instead a policy that will only work for a particular version
  of a particular task with particular initial parameters. In response, researchers
  have begun exploring randomization of problem parameters to counteract such overfitting
  and to allow trained policies to more easily transfer from one environment to another,
  such as from a simulated robot to a robot in the real world. Here we review the
  large amount of existing work on PCG, which we believe has an important role to
  play in increasing the generality of machine learning methods. The main goal here
  is to present RL/AI with new tools from the PCG toolbox, and its secondary goal
  is to explain to game developers and researchers a way in which their work is relevant
  to AI research.
