abstract: In 2016, we introduced AlphaGo, the first artificial intelligence (AI) program
  to defeat humans at the ancient game of Go. Two years later, its successor - AlphaZero
  - learned from scratch to master Go, chess and shogi. Now, in a paper in the journal
  Nature, we describe MuZero, a significant step forward in the pursuit of general-purpose
  algorithms. MuZero masters Go, chess, shogi and Atari without needing to be told
  the rules, thanks to its ability to plan winning strategies in unknown environments.
