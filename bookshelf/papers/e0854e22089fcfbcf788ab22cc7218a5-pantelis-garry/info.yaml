abstract: This book explores an alternative to the current dominant paradigm where
  a discrete computer model is constructed as an attempt to approximate some continuum
  theory. We focus on a class of discrete computer models that are based on simple
  deterministic rules and finite state arithmetic. Such models are highly compatible
  with the operational parameters of the real world computer on which they are executed
  and hence their validation can be associated with the allowable computations on
  the machine. A simple formal system based on a language of functional programs is
  employed as a tool of analysis.
