abstract: Bove and Capretta's popular method for justifying function definitions by
  general recursive equations is based on the observation that any structured general
  recursion equation defines an inductive subset of the intended domain (the "domain
  of definedness") for which the equation has a unique solution. To accept the definition,
  it is hence enough to prove that this subset contains the whole intended domain.   This
  approach works very well for "terminating" definitions. But it fails to account
  for "productive" definitions, such as typical definitions of stream-valued functions.
  We argue that such definitions can be treated in a similar spirit, proceeding from
  a different unique solvability criterion. Any structured recursive equation defines
  a coinductive relation between the intended domain and intended codomain (the "coinductive
  graph"). This relation in turn determines a subset of the intended domain and a
  quotient of the intended codomain with the property that the equation is uniquely
  solved for the subset and quotient. The equation is therefore guaranteed to have
  a unique solution for the intended domain and intended codomain whenever the subset
  is the full set and the quotient is by equality.
