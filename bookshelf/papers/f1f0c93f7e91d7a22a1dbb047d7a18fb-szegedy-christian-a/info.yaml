abstract: 'Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved
  state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their
  expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable
  solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report
  two such properties.   First, we find that there is no distinction between individual
  high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to
  various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than
  the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers
  of neural networks.   Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output
  mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the
  network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation,
  which is found by maximizing the network''s prediction error. In addition, the specific
  nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation
  can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset,
  to misclassify the same input.'
