abstract: The quest to understand consciousness, once the purview of philosophers
  and theologians, is now actively pursued by scientists of many stripes. This paper
  studies consciousness from the perspective of theoretical computer science. It formalizes
  the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) originated by cognitive neuroscientist Bernard
  Baars and further developed by him, Stanislas Dehaene, and others. Our major contribution
  lies in the precise formal definition of a Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), also
  called a Conscious AI. We define the CTM in the spirit of Alan Turing's simple yet
  powerful definition of a computer, the Turing Machine (TM). We are not looking for
  a complex model of the brain nor of cognition but for a simple model of (the admittedly
  complex concept of) consciousness. After formally defining CTM, we give a formal
  definition of consciousness in CTM. We then suggest why the CTM has the feeling
  of consciousness. The reasonableness of the definitions and explanations can be
  judged by how well they agree with commonly accepted intuitive concepts of human
  consciousness, the breadth of related concepts that the model explains easily and
  naturally, and the extent of its agreement with scientific evidence.
