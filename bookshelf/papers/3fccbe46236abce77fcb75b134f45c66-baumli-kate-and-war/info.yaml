abstract: In the absence of external rewards, agents can still learn useful behaviors
  by identifying and mastering a set of diverse skills within their environment. Existing
  skill learning methods use mutual information objectives to incentivize each skill
  to be diverse and distinguishable from the rest. However, if care is not taken to
  constrain the ways in which the skills are diverse, trivially diverse skill sets
  can arise. To ensure useful skill diversity, we propose a novel skill learning objective,
  Relative Variational Intrinsic Control (RVIC), which incentivizes learning skills
  that are distinguishable in how they change the agent's relationship to its environment.
  The resulting set of skills tiles the space of affordances available to the agent.
  We qualitatively analyze skill behaviors on multiple environments and show how RVIC
  skills are more useful than skills discovered by existing methods when used in hierarchical
  reinforcement learning.
