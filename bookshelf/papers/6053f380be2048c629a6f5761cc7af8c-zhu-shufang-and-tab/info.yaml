abstract: Temporal logic is often used to describe temporal properties in AI applications.
  The most popular language for doing so is Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Recently,
  LTL on finite traces, LTLf, has been investigated in several contexts. In order
  to reason about LTLf, formulas are typically compiled into deterministic finite
  automata (DFA), as the intermediate semantic representation. Moreover, due to the
  fact that DFAs have canonical representation, efficient minimization algorithms
  can be applied to maximally reduce DFA size, helping to speed up subsequent computations.
  Here, we present a thorough investigation on two classical minimization algorithms,
  namely, the Hopcroft and Brzozowski algorithms. More specifically, we show how to
  apply these algorithms to semi-symbolic (explicit states, symbolic transition functions)
  automata representation. We then compare the two algorithms in the context of an
  LTLf-synthesis framework, starting from LTLf formulas. While earlier studies on
  comparing the two algorithms starting from randomly-generated automata concluded
  that neither algorithm dominates, our results suggest that starting from LTLf formulas,
  Hopcroft's algorithm is the best choice in the context of reactive synthesis. Deeper
  analysis explains why the supposed advantage of Brzozowski's algorithm does not
  materialize in practice.
