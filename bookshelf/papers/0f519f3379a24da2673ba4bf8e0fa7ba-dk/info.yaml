abstract: Explore the human mind and understand the science behind how you and other
  people in your life think and act in a wide range of everyday situations with this
  brand new visual guide to applied psychology.Using straightforward definitions and
  clear, striking visuals, The Psychology Handbook makes the workings of the brain
  easy to understand and shows what happens when things go wrong, with information
  on disorders such as anxiety and paranoia, as well as explanations of the different
  therapies that are used to treat them, from CBT to psychoanalysis, group therapy
  to art therapy. Clear and easy to understand for both students and readers with
  a general interest, this book explores and explains the various approaches that
  psychologists use to study how people think and behave, such as behaviourism, cognitive
  psychology, and humanism. It also shows how these approaches can be applied to real-world
  situations, with examples from the workplace to the sports field, the courtroom
  to the classroom. Learn why psychology plays a huge role in all of our lives and
  develop a greater understanding of what influences our behaviour, thoughts and feelings,
  and those of others, in a variety of environments and scenarios.
