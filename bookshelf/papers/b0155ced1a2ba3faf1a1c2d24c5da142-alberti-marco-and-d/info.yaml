abstract: In multiagent systems, agent interaction is ruled by means of interaction
  protocols. Compliance to protocols can be hardwired in agent programs; however,
  this requires that only certified agents interact. In open societies, composed of
  autonomous and heterogeneous agents whose internal structure is, in general, not
  accessible, interaction protocols should be specified in terms of the agent observable
  behaviour, and compliance should be verified by an external entity.In this paper,
  we propose a Java-Prolog-CHR system for verification of compliance of agents' behaviour
  to protocols specified in a logic-based formalism (Social Integrity Constraints).
  We also present the application of the formalism and the system to the specification
  and verification of the FIPA Contract-Net protocol.
