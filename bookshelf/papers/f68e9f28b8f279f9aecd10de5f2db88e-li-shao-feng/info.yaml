abstract: <jats:p>With the increasingly complex of computer software system, traditional
  software engineering methods for major software development will inevitably produce
  a lot of mistakes and catastrophic consequences for key industry users. Experiment
  with software engineering methods cannot guarantee the behavior at infinity reliability
  and security of the state space. All this requires formal analysis and verification
  to the complex system. In protocol verification based on automatic machines, the
  automaton is used to represent the behavior of the system, the time automaton is
  a formal method can be well applied to the network protocol verification.</jats:p>
