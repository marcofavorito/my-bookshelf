abstract: Since its inception, the blockchain technology has shown promising application
  prospects. From the initial cryptocurrency to the current smart contract, blockchain
  has been applied to many fields. Although there are some studies on the security
  and privacy issues of blockchain, there lacks a systematic examination on the security
  of blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the security
  threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular
  blockchain systems. We also review the security enhancement solutions for blockchain,
  which could be used in the development of various blockchain systems, and suggest
  some future directions to stir research efforts into this area.
