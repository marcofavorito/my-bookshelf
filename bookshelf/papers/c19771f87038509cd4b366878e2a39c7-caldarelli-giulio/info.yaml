abstract: <jats:p>Scarce and niche in the literature just a few years ago, the blockchain
  topic is now the main subject in conference papers and books. However, the hype
  generated by the technology and its potential implications for real-world applications
  is flawed by many misconceptions about how it works and how it is implemented, creating
  faulty thinking or overly optimistic expectations. Too often, characteristics such
  as immutability, transparency, and censorship resistance, which mainly belong to
  the bitcoin blockchain, are sought in regular blockchains, whose potential is barely
  comparable. Furthermore, critical aspects such as oracles and their role in smart
  contracts receive few literature contributions, leaving results and theoretical
  implications highly questionable. This literature review of the latest papers in
  the field aims to give clarity to the blockchain oracle problem by discussing its
  effects in some of the most promising real-world applications. The analysis supports
  the view that the more trusted a system is, the less the oracle problem impacts.</jats:p>
