abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence often stem from the development of new
  environments that abstract real-world situations into a form where research can
  be done conveniently. This paper contributes such an environment based on ideas
  inspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce resources in a spatially
  complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that they prefer.
  We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing behaviors respond
  to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by supply and demand shifts
  in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where the agents' emergent prices
  for goods vary over space, reflecting the local abundance of goods. After the price
  disparities emerge, some agents then discover a niche of transporting goods between
  regions with different prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can
  buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally,
  in a series of ablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental
  rewards, bartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable
  goods can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work
  is part of the environment development branch of a research program that aims to
  build human-like artificial general intelligence through multi-agent interactions
  in simulated societies. By exploring which environment features are needed for the
  basic phenomena of elementary microeconomics to emerge automatically from learning,
  we arrive at an environment that differs from those studied in prior multi-agent
  reinforcement learning work along several dimensions. For example, the model incorporates
  heterogeneous tastes and physical abilities, and agents negotiate with one another
  as a grounded form of communication.
