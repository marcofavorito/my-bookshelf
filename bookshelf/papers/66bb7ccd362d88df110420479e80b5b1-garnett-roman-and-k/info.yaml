abstract: We consider two active binary-classification problems with atypical objectives.
  In the first, active search, our goal is to actively uncover as many members of
  a given class as possible. In the second, active surveying, our goal is to actively
  query points to ultimately predict the proportion of a given class. Numerous real-world
  problems can be framed in these terms, and in either case typical model-based concerns
  such as generalization error are only of secondary importance.   We approach these
  problems via Bayesian decision theory; after choosing natural utility functions,
  we derive the optimal policies. We provide three contributions. In addition to introducing
  the active surveying problem, we extend previous work on active search in two ways.
  First, we prove a novel theoretical result, that less-myopic approximations to the
  optimal policy can outperform more-myopic approximations by any arbitrary degree.
  We then derive bounds that for certain models allow us to reduce (in practice dramatically)
  the exponential search space required by a naive implementation of the optimal policy,
  enabling further lookahead while still ensuring that optimal decisions are always
  made.
