abstract: Online applications now routinely replicate their data at multiple sites
  around the world. In this paper we present Atlas, the first state-machine replication
  protocol tailored for such planet-scale systems. Atlas does not rely on a distinguished
  leader, so clients enjoy the same quality of service independently of their geographical
  locations. Furthermore, client-perceived latency improves as we add sites closer
  to clients. To achieve this, Atlas minimizes the size of its quorums using an observation
  that concurrent data center failures are rare. It also processes a high percentage
  of accesses in a single round trip, even when these conflict. We experimentally
  demonstrate that Atlas consistently outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in planet-scale
  scenarios. In particular, Atlas is up to two times faster than Flexible Paxos with
  identical failure assumptions, and more than doubles the performance of Egalitarian
  Paxos in the YCSB benchmark.
