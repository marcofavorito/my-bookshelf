abstract: Motivated by recent increased interest in optimization algorithms for non-convex
  optimization in application to training deep neural networks and other optimization
  problems in data analysis, we give an overview of recent theoretical results on
  global performance guarantees of optimization algorithms for non-convex optimization.
  We start with classical arguments showing that general non-convex problems could
  not be solved efficiently in a reasonable time. Then we give a list of problems
  that can be solved efficiently to find the global minimizer by exploiting the structure
  of the problem as much as it is possible. Another way to deal with non-convexity
  is to relax the goal from finding the global minimum to finding a stationary point
  or a local minimum. For this setting, we first present known results for the convergence
  rates of deterministic first-order methods, which are then followed by a general
  theoretical analysis of optimal stochastic and randomized gradient schemes, and
  an overview of the stochastic first-order methods. After that, we discuss quite
  general classes of non-convex problems, such as minimization of $\alpha$-weakly-quasi-convex
  functions and functions that satisfy Polyak--Lojasiewicz condition, which still
  allow obtaining theoretical convergence guarantees of first-order methods. Then
  we consider higher-order and zeroth-order/derivative-free methods and their convergence
  rates for non-convex optimization problems.
