abstract: Model complexity is a fundamental problem in deep learning. In this paper
  we conduct a systematic overview of the latest studies on model complexity in deep
  learning. Model complexity of deep learning can be categorized into expressive capacity
  and effective model complexity. We review the existing studies on those two categories
  along four important factors, including model framework, model size, optimization
  process and data complexity. We also discuss the applications of deep learning model
  complexity including understanding model generalization capability, model optimization,
  and model selection and design. We conclude by proposing several interesting future
  directions.
