abstract: Building secure communication systems requires both secure cryptographic
  primitives and also secure cryptographic protocols that build messaging schemes
  on top of those primitives. Well-designed protocols are the backbone of almost all
  modern digital communication, enabling key exchange, entity authentication, secure
  channels, and anonymous messaging. On the other hand, improperly designed protocols
  can render the best [â€¦]
