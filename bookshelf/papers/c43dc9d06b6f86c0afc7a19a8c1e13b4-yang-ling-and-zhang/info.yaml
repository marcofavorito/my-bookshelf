abstract: 'Diffusion models are a class of deep generative models that have shown
  impressive results on various tasks with a solid theoretical foundation. Despite
  demonstrated success than state-of-the-art approaches, diffusion models often entail
  costly sampling procedures and sub-optimal likelihood estimation. Significant efforts
  have been made to improve the performance of diffusion models in various aspects.
  In this article, we present a comprehensive review of existing variants of diffusion
  models. Specifically, we provide the taxonomy of research in diffusion models and
  categorize them into three types: sampling-efficiency enhancement, likelihood-maximization
  enhancement, and data-generalization enhancement. We also introduce the other generative
  models (i.e., variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing
  flow, autoregressive models, and energy-based models) and discuss the connections
  between diffusion models and these generative models. Then we review the applications
  of diffusion models, including computer vision, natural language processing, temporal
  data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, molecular graph modeling,
  material design, and inverse problem solving. Furthermore, we propose new perspectives
  pertaining to the development of generative models. Github: https://github.com/YangLing0818/Diffusion-Models-Papers-Survey-Taxonomy.'
