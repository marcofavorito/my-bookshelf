abstract: 'Exploration is a fundamental challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
  based model-free navigation control since typical exploration techniques for target-driven
  navigation tasks rely on noise or greedy policies, which are sensitive to the density
  of rewards. In practice, robots are always deployed in complex cluttered environments,
  containing dense obstacles and narrow passageways, raising natural spare rewards
  that are hard to explore for training. Such a problem becomes even more serious
  when pre-defined tasks are complex and have rich expressivity. In this paper, we
  focus on these two aspects and present a deep policy gradient algorithm for a task-guided
  robot with unknown dynamics deployed in a complex cluttered environment. Linear
  Temporal Logic (LTL) is used to express rich robotic specifications. To overcome
  the environmental challenge of exploration during training, we propose a novel path
  planning-guided reward scheme that is dense over the state space, and crucially,
  robust to the infeasibility of computed geometric paths due to the black-box dynamics.
  The long or infinite horizons of general LTL specifications are often an issue for
  DRL due to its myopic tendencies. To facilitate LTL satisfaction, our approach decomposes
  the LTL mission into sub-tasks that are solved using distributed DRL, where the
  sub-tasks can be trained in parallel, using Deep Policy Gradient algorithms. Our
  framework is shown to significantly improve performance (effectiveness, efficiency)
  and exploration of robots tasked with complex missions in large-scale complex environments.
