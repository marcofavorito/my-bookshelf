abstract: "TLA gave me, for the first time, a formalism in which it was possible to\
  \ write completely formal proofs without first having to add an additional layer\
  \ of formal semantics.  I began writing proofs the way I and all mathematicians\
  \ and computer scientists had learned to write them, using a sequence of lemmas\
  \ whose proofs were a mixture of prose and formulas.  I quickly discovered that\
  \ this approach collapsed under the weight of the complexity of any nontrivial proof.\
  \  I became lost in a maze of details, and couldn't keep track of what had and had\
  \ not been proved at any point.  Programmers learned long ago that the way to handle\
  \ complexity is with hierarchical structuring.  So, it was quite natural to start\
  \ structuring the proofs hierarchically, and I soon developed a simple hierarchical\
  \ proof style.  It then occurred to me that this structured proof style should be\
  \ good for ordinary mathematical proofs, not just for formal verification of systems.\
  \  Trying it out, I found that it was great.  I now never write old-fashioned unstructured\
  \ proofs for myself, and use them only in some papers for short proof sketches that\
  \ are not meant to be rigorous.  \n\nI first presented these ideas in a talk at\
  \ a celebration of the 60th birthday of Richard Palais, my de jure thesis advisor,\
  \ collaborator, and friend.  I was invited along with all of Palais' former doctoral\
  \ students, and I was the only non-mathematician who gave a talk.  (I believe all\
  \ the other talks presented that day appear among the articles in the volume edited\
  \ by Uhlenbeck.)  Lots of people jumped on me for trying to take the fun out of\
  \ mathematics.  The strength of their reaction indicates that I hit a nerve.  Perhaps\
  \ they really do think it's fun having to recreate the proofs themselves if they\
  \ want to know whether a theorem in a published paper is actually correct, and to\
  \ have to struggle to figure out why a particular step in the proof is supposed\
  \ to hold.  I republished the paper in the AMM Monthly so it would reach a larger\
  \ audience of mathematicians.  Maybe I should republish it again for computer scientists."
