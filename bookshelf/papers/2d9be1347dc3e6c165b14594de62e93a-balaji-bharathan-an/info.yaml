abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved state-of-the-art results in domains
  such as robotics and games. We build on this previous work by applying RL algorithms
  to a selection of canonical online stochastic optimization problems with a range
  of practical applications: Bin Packing, Newsvendor, and Vehicle Routing. While there
  is a nascent literature that applies RL to these problems, there are no commonly
  accepted benchmarks which can be used to compare proposed approaches rigorously
  in terms of performance, scale, or generalizability. This paper aims to fill that
  gap. For each problem we apply both standard approaches as well as newer RL algorithms
  and analyze results. In each case, the performance of the trained RL policy is competitive
  with or superior to the corresponding baselines, while not requiring much in the
  way of domain knowledge. This highlights the potential of RL in real-world dynamic
  resource allocation problems.'
