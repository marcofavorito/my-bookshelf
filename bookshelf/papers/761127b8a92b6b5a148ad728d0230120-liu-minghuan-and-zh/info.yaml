abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), related to a set of complex
  RL problems, trains an agent to achieve different goals under particular scenarios.
  Compared to the standard RL solutions that learn a policy solely depending on the
  states or observations, GCRL additionally requires the agent to make decisions according
  to different goals. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges
  and algorithms for GCRL. Firstly, we answer what the basic problems are studied
  in this field. Then, we explain how goals are represented and present how existing
  solutions are designed from different points of view. Finally, we make the conclusion
  and discuss potential future prospects that recent researches focus on.
