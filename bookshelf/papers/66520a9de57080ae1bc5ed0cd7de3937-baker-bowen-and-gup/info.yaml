abstract: At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires
  both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation
  or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling
  algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing
  CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially
  choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy
  and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures
  and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task.
  On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only
  standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks
  designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art
  methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling
  approaches for network design on image classification tasks.
