abstract: 'Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation
  of general artificial intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or smarter
  than humans. The dominant approach in the machine learning community is to attempt
  to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence, with the implicit assumption
  that some future group will complete the Herculean task of figuring out how to combine
  all of those pieces into a complex thinking machine. I call this the "manual AI
  approach". This paper describes another exciting path that ultimately may be more
  successful at producing general AI. It is based on the clear trend in machine learning
  that hand-designed solutions eventually are replaced by more effective, learned
  solutions. The idea is to create an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which automatically
  learns how to produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach:
  (1) meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves,
  and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that either approach
  could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically worthwhile irrespective
  of which is the fastest path. Because both are promising, yet the ML community is
  currently committed to the manual approach, I argue that our community should increase
  its research investment in the AI-GA approach. To encourage such research, I describe
  promising work in each of the Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety
  and ethical considerations. Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI
  and because it is inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions
  in which a simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian
  evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs should
  be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.'
