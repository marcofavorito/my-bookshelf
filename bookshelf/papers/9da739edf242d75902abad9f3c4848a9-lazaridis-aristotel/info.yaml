abstract: '<jats:p>Deep Reinforcement Learning is a topic that has gained a lot of
  attention recently, due to the unprecedented achievements and remarkable performance
  of such algorithms in various benchmark tests and environmental setups. The power
  of such methods comes from the combination of an already established and strong
  field of Deep Learning, with the unique nature of Reinforcement Learning methods.
  It is, however, deemed necessary to provide a compact, accurate and comparable view
  of these methods and their results for the means of gaining valuable technical and
  practical insights. In this work we gather the essential methods related to Deep
  Reinforcement Learning, extracting common property structures for three complementary
  core categories: a) Model-Free, b) Model-Based and c) Modular algorithms. For each
  category, we present, analyze and compare state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning
  algorithms that achieve high performance in various environments and tackle challenging
  problems in complex and demanding tasks. In order to give a compact and practical
  overview of their differences, we present comprehensive comparison figures and tables,
  produced by reported performances of the algorithms under two popular simulation
  platforms: the Atari Learning Environment and the MuJoCo physics simulation platform.
  We discuss the key differences of the various kinds of algorithms, indicate their
  potential and limitations, as well as provide insights to researchers regarding
  future directions of the field.</jats:p>'
