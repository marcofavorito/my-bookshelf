abstract: Recent years have seen increasing popularity of logic-based reasoning systems,
  with research and industrial interest as well as many flourishing applications in
  the area of Knowledge Graphs. Despite that, one can observe a substantial lack of
  specific tools able to generate nontrivial reasoning settings and benchmark scenarios.
  As a consequence, evaluating, analysing and comparing reasoning systems is a complex
  task, especially when they embody sophisticated optimizations and execution techniques
  that leverage the theoretical underpinnings of the adopted logic fragment. In this
  paper, we aim at filling this gap by introducing iWarded, a system that can generate
  very large, complex, realistic reasoning settings to be used for the benchmarking
  of logic-based reasoning systems adopting Datalog+/-, a family of extensions of
  Datalog that has seen a resurgence in the last few years. In particular, iWarded
  generates reasoning settings for Warded Datalog+/-, a language with a very good
  tradeoff between computational complexity and expressive power. In the paper, we
  present the iWarded system and a set of novel theoretical results adopted to generate
  effective scenarios. As Datalog-based languages are of general interest and see
  increasing adoption, we believe that iWarded is a step forward in the empirical
  evaluation of current and future systems.
