abstract: By Peter J Bentley It is perhaps inevitable that on the anniversary of Turing’s
  birth we should wax lyrical about Turing’s great achievements, and the loss to the
  world following his premature death. Turing was a pioneer of theoretical computing
  – his ideas are still used to this day in our attempts to understand what we can
  and cannot compute. His achievements are tremendous in many aspects of mathematics,
  computing, and the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence. But our digitized world
  was not created by one man alone. Turing’s work was one of many key pioneers of
  his era. If only we could listen to the views of a direct contemporary of Turing,
  we might learn a more complete picture.
