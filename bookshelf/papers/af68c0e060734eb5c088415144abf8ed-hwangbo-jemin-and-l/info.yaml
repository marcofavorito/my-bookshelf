abstract: 'Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic
  and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted
  by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal
  craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so
  far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation,
  and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems.
  The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically
  balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce
  a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it
  to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective
  data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated
  medium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal
  machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior
  methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level
  body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling
  even in complex configurations.'
