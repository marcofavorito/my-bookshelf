abstract: "<jats:p>\n            The game of checkers has roughly 500 billion billion\
  \ possible positions (5 × 10\n            <jats:sup>20</jats:sup>\n            ).\
  \ The task of solving the game, determining the final result in a game with no mistakes\
  \ made by either player, is daunting. Since 1989, almost continuously, dozens of\
  \ computers have been working on solving checkers, applying state-of-the-art artificial\
  \ intelligence techniques to the proving process. This paper announces that checkers\
  \ is now solved: Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. This is the most challenging\
  \ popular game to be solved to date, roughly one million times as complex as Connect\
  \ Four. Artificial intelligence technology has been used to generate strong heuristic-based\
  \ game-playing programs, such as Deep Blue for chess. Solving a game takes this\
  \ to the next level by replacing the heuristics with perfection.\n          </jats:p>"
