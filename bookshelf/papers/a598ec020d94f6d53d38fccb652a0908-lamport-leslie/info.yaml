abstract: <jats:p>Recent archaeological discoveries on the island of Paxos reveal
  that the parliament functioned despite the peripatetic propensity of its part-time
  legislators. The legislators maintained consistent copies of the parliamentary record,
  despite their frequent forays from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers.
  The Paxon parliament's protocol provides a new way of implementing the state machine
  approach to the design of distributed systems.</jats:p>
