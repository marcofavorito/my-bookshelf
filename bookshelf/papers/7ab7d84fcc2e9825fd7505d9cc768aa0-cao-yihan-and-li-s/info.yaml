abstract: Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant
  attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in
  related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its
  impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques
  belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which
  involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language,
  through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more
  efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at
  a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information
  from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its
  knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become
  increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus,
  improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models,
  the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer
  to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This
  survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and
  basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal
  interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks
  and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we
  introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally,
  we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.
