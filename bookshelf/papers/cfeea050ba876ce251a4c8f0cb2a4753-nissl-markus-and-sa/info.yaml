abstract: In recent years, manifold blockchain protocols have been proposed by researchers
  and industrial companies alike. This has led to a very heterogeneous blockchain
  landscape. Accordingly, it would be desirable if blockchains could interact with
  each other. However, current blockchain technologies offer only limited support
  for interoperability, thus preventing tokens or smart contracts from leaving the
  scope of a particular blockchain.   As a first step towards a solution for cross-chain
  smart contract interactions, we introduce a framework which allows to invoke a smart
  contract from another blockchain. We offer support for continuing a smart contract
  after receiving a result from a different blockchain, and for calling smart contracts
  recursively across blockchains. We provide a reference implementation for Ethereum-based
  blockchains using Solidity and evaluate the performance regarding time and cost
  overheads.
