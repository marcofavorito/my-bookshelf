abstract: This is the six-page version of [165]. I think it is also the first place
  I have mentioned the Whorfian syndrome in print. It is structured around a lovely
  simple example in which an important hardware protocol is derived from a trivial
  specification by substituting an expression for the specification's variable. This
  example is supporting evidence for the thesis of [168] that computation should be
  described with mathematics. (Substitution of an expression for a variable is an
  elementary operation of mathematics, but is meaningless in a programming language.)
