abstract: Words and phrases acquire meaning from the way they are used in society,
  from their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers the equivalent
  of `society' is `database,' and the equivalent of `use' is `way to search the database.'
  We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information
  distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts we use the world-wide-web as
  database, and Google as search engine. The method is also applicable to other search
  engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically
  extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the
  world-wide-web using Google page counts. The world-wide-web is the largest database
  on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages
  out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical
  clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish
  between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters
  and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies,
  and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish
  translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against
  which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial
  in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based
  on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87% with the expert
  crafted WordNet categories.
