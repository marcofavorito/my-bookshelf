abstract: 'Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted
  in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm
  with respect to a certain resource, e.g. the number of training examples or the
  number of training iterations. Learning curves have important applications in several
  contexts of machine learning, most importantly for the context of data acquisition,
  early stopping of model training and model selection. For example, by modelling
  the learning curves, one can assess at an early stage whether the algorithm and
  hyperparameter configuration have the potential to be a suitable choice, often speeding
  up the algorithm selection process. A variety of approaches has been proposed to
  use learning curves for decision making. Some models answer the binary decision
  question of whether a certain algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain
  reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve
  of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorizes learning curve approaches
  using three criteria: the decision situation that they address, the intrinsic learning
  curve question that they answer and the type of resources that they use. We survey
  papers from literature and classify them into this framework.'
