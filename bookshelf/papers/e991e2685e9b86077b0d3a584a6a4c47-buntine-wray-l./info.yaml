abstract: 'Theory refinement is the task of updating a domain theory in the light
  of new cases, to be done automatically or with some expert assistance. The problem
  of theory refinement under uncertainty is reviewed here in the context of Bayesian
  statistics, a theory of belief revision. The problem is reduced to an incremental
  learning task as follows: the learning system is initially primed with a partial
  theory supplied by a domain expert, and thereafter maintains its own internal representation
  of alternative theories which is able to be interrogated by the domain expert and
  able to be incrementally refined from data. Algorithms for refinement of Bayesian
  networks are presented to illustrate what is meant by "partial theory", "alternative
  theory representation", etc. The algorithms are an incremental variant of batch
  learning algorithms from the literature so can work well in batch and incremental
  mode.'
