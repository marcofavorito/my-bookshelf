abstract: We introduce AndroidEnv, an open-source platform for Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) research built on top of the Android ecosystem. AndroidEnv allows RL agents
  to interact with a wide variety of apps and services commonly used by humans through
  a universal touchscreen interface. Since agents train on a realistic simulation
  of an Android device, they have the potential to be deployed on real devices. In
  this report, we give an overview of the environment, highlighting the significant
  features it provides for research, and we present an empirical evaluation of some
  popular reinforcement learning agents on a set of tasks built on this platform.
