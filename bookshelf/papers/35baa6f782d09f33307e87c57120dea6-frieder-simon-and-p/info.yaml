abstract: 'We investigate the mathematical capabilities of two iterations of ChatGPT
  (released 9-January-2023 and 30-January-2023) and of GPT-4 by testing them on publicly
  available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, using a novel methodology. In
  contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal proofs are available
  (e.g., the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics,
  used to benchmark language models, either cover only elementary mathematics or are
  very small. We address this by publicly releasing two new datasets: GHOSTS and miniGHOSTS.
  These are the first natural-language datasets curated by working researchers in
  mathematics that (1) aim to cover graduate-level mathematics, (2) provide a holistic
  overview of the mathematical capabilities of language models, and (3) distinguish
  multiple dimensions of mathematical reasoning. These datasets also test whether
  ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be helpful assistants to professional mathematicians by emulating
  use cases that arise in the daily professional activities of mathematicians. We
  benchmark the models on a range of fine-grained performance metrics. For advanced
  mathematics, this is the most detailed evaluation effort to date. We find that ChatGPT
  can be used most successfully as a mathematical assistant for querying facts, acting
  as a mathematical search engine and knowledge base interface. GPT-4 can additionally
  be used for undergraduate-level mathematics but fails on graduate-level difficulty.
  Contrary to many positive reports in the media about GPT-4 and ChatGPT''s exam-solving
  abilities (a potential case of selection bias), their overall mathematical performance
  is well below the level of a graduate student. Hence, if your goal is to use ChatGPT
  to pass a graduate-level math exam, you would be better off copying from your average
  peer!'
