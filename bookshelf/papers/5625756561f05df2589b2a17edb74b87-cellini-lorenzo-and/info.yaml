abstract: The bin packing is a well-known NP-Hard problem in the domain of artificial
  intelligence, posing significant challenges in finding efficient solutions. Conversely,
  recent advancements in quantum technologies have shown promising potential for achieving
  substantial computational speedup, particularly in certain problem classes, such
  as combinatorial optimization. In this study, we introduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic
  Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation designed specifically for bin
  packing and suitable for quantum computation. QAL-BP utilizes the augmented Lagrangian
  method to incorporate the bin packing constraints into the objective function while
  also facilitating an analytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust,
  penalty multipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model
  that eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent Lagrangian
  coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO formulations
  for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct
  experiments on a set of bin-packing instances using a real Quantum Annealing device.
  Additionally, we compare the results with those obtained from two different classical
  solvers, namely simulated annealing and Gurobi. The experimental findings not only
  confirm the correctness of the proposed formulation but also demonstrate the potential
  of quantum computation in effectively solving the bin-packing problem, particularly
  as more reliable quantum technology becomes available.
