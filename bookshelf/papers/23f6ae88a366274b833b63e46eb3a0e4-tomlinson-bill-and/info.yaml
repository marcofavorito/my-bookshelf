abstract: As AI systems proliferate, their greenhouse gas emissions are an increasingly
  important concern for human societies. We analyze the emissions of several AI systems
  (ChatGPT, BLOOM, DALL-E2, Midjourney) relative to those of humans completing the
  same tasks. We find that an AI writing a page of text emits 130 to 1500 times less
  CO2e than a human doing so. Similarly, an AI creating an image emits 310 to 2900
  times less. Emissions analysis do not account for social impacts such as professional
  displacement, legality, and rebound effects. In addition, AI is not a substitute
  for all human tasks. Nevertheless, at present, the use of AI holds the potential
  to carry out several major activities at much lower emission levels than can humans.
