abstract: We analyse the income distributions of cities in France and the scaling
  of the income of different deciles as a function of the population. We find a significant
  difference in the scaling exponents for the richer and poorer parts of the population,
  implying an unequivocal rise in inequalities in larger cities, made worse by living
  costs that are disproportionately higher for the poor. We find that the distribution
  of revenues of cities in France has a universal, Gumbel-like form, with mean and
  variance growing with the logarithm of population. We show how this result directly
  implies different income scaling exponents as a function of decile. We also study
  the spatial correlations of income and population, which decay exponentially with
  distance. We find that large cities are not more income-segregated than small cities.
  Finally, we search for couplings between social and economic factors, like age and
  income, and propose a toy model that reproduces some of our observations.
