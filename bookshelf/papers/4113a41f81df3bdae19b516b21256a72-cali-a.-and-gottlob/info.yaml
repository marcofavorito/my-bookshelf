abstract: '<jats:p>The chase algorithm is a fundamental tool for query evaluation
  and for testing query containment under tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and
  equality-generating dependencies (EGDs).  So far, most of the research on this topic
  has focused on cases where the chase procedure terminates.  This paper introduces
  expressive classes of TGDs defined via syntactic restrictions: guarded TGDs (GTGDs)
  and weakly guarded sets of TGDs (WGTGDs).  For these classes, the chase procedure
  is not guaranteed to terminate and thus may have an infinite outcome. Nevertheless,
  we prove that the problems of conjunctive-query answering and query containment
  under such TGDs are decidable.  We provide decision procedures and tight complexity
  bounds for these problems.  Then we show how EGDs can be incorporated into our results
  by providing conditions under which EGDs do not harmfully interact with TGDs and
  do not affect the decidability and complexity of query answering.  We show applications
  of the aforesaid classes of constraints to the problem of answering conjunctive
  queries in F-Logic Lite, an object-oriented ontology language, and in some tractable
  Description Logics.
