abstract: '<jats:p>One task of metamathematics is to relate suggestive but nonelementary
  modeltheoretic concepts to more elementary proof-theoretic concepts, thereby opening
  up modeltheoretic problems to proof-theoretic methods of attack. Herbrand''s Theorem
  (see [8] or also [9], vol. 2) or Gentzen''s Extended Hauptsatz (see [5] or also
  [10]) was first used along these lines by Beth [1]. Using a modified version he
  showed that for all first-order systems a certain modeltheoretic notion of definability
  coincides with a certain proof theoretic notion. In the present paper the Herbrand-Gentzen
  Theorem will be applied to generalize Beth''s results from primitive predicate symbols
  to arbitrary formulas and terms.</jats:p><jats:p>This may be interpreted as showing
  that (apart from some relatively minor exceptions which will be made apparent below)
  the expressive power of each first-order system is rounded out, or the system is
  <jats:italic>functionally complete</jats:italic>, in the following sense: Any functional
  relationship which obtains between concepts that are expressible in the system is
  itself expressible and provable in the system.</jats:p><jats:p>A second application
  is concerned with the hierarchy of second-order formulas. A certain relationship
  is shown to hold between first-order formulas and those second-order formulas which
  are of the form (∃T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>)…(∃T<jats:sub><jats:italic>k</jats:italic></jats:sub>)A
  or (T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>)…(T<jats:sub><jats:italic>k</jats:italic></jats:sub>)A
  with A being a first-order formula. Modeltheoretically this can be regarded as a
  relationship between the class <jats:bold>AC</jats:bold> and the class <jats:bold>PC</jats:bold><jats:sub>⊿</jats:sub>
  of sets of models, investigated by Tarski in [12] and [13].</jats:p>'
