abstract: <jats:p>The sexual division of labor among human foraging populations has
  typically been recognized as involving males as hunters and females as gatherers.
  Recent archeological research has questioned this paradigm with evidence that females
  hunted (and went to war) throughout the <jats:italic>Homo sapiens</jats:italic>
  lineage, though many of these authors assert the pattern of women hunting may only
  have occurred in the past. The current project gleans data from across the ethnographic
  literature to investigate the prevalence of women hunting in foraging societies
  in more recent times. Evidence from the past one hundred years supports archaeological
  finds from the Holocene that women from a broad range of cultures intentionally
  hunt for subsistence. These results aim to shift the male-hunter female-gatherer
  paradigm to account for the significant role females have in hunting, thus dramatically
  shifting stereotypes of labor, as well as mobility.</jats:p>
