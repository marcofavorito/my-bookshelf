abstract: Computer simulations offer a robust toolset for exploring complex systems
  across various disciplines. A particularly impactful approach within this realm
  is Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which harnesses the interactions of individual agents
  to emulate intricate system dynamics. ABM's strength lies in its bottom-up methodology,
  illuminating emergent phenomena by modeling the behaviors of individual components
  of a system. Yet, ABM has its own set of challenges, notably its struggle with modeling
  natural language instructions and common sense in mathematical equations or rules.
  This paper seeks to transcend these boundaries by integrating Large Language Models
  (LLMs) like GPT into ABM. This amalgamation gives birth to a novel framework, Smart
  Agent-Based Modeling (SABM). Building upon the concept of smart agents -- entities
  characterized by their intelligence, adaptability, and computation ability -- we
  explore in the direction of utilizing LLM-powered agents to simulate real-world
  scenarios with increased nuance and realism. In this comprehensive exploration,
  we elucidate the state of the art of ABM, introduce SABM's potential and methodology,
  and present three case studies (source codes available at https://github.com/Roihn/SABM),
  demonstrating the SABM methodology and validating its effectiveness in modeling
  real-world systems. Furthermore, we cast a vision towards several aspects of the
  future of SABM, anticipating a broader horizon for its applications. Through this
  endeavor, we aspire to redefine the boundaries of computer simulations, enabling
  a more profound understanding of complex systems.
