abstract: 'In the COVID-19 outbreak, governments have applied progressive restrictions
  to production activities, permitting only those that are considered strategic or
  that provide essential services. This is particularly apparent in countries that
  have been stricken hard by the virus, with Italy being a major example. Yet we know
  that companies are not just isolated entities: They organize themselves into intricate
  shareholding structures --- forming company networks --- distributing decision power
  and dividends in sophisticated schemes for various purposes.   One tool from the
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) toolbox that is particularly effective to perform reasoning
  tasks on domains characterized by many entities highly interconnected with one another
  is Knowledge Graphs (KG). In this work, we present a visionary opinion and report
  on ongoing work about the application of Automated Reasoning and Knowledge Graph
  technology to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the network of Italian
  companies and support the application of legal instruments for the protection of
  strategic companies from takeovers.'
