abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown huge potentials in building
  financial market simulators recently. However, due to the highly complex and dynamic
  nature of real-world markets, raw historical financial data often involve large
  noise and may not reflect the future of markets, degrading the fidelity of DRL-based
  market simulators. Moreover, the accuracy of DRL-based market simulators heavily
  relies on numerous and diverse DRL agents, which increases demand for a universe
  of market environments and imposes a challenge on simulation speed. In this paper,
  we present a FinRL-Meta framework that builds a universe of market environments
  for data-driven financial reinforcement learning. First, FinRL-Meta separates financial
  data processing from the design pipeline of DRL-based strategy and provides open-source
  data engineering tools for financial big data. Second, FinRL-Meta provides hundreds
  of market environments for various trading tasks. Third, FinRL-Meta enables multiprocessing
  simulation and training by exploiting thousands of GPU cores. Our codes are available
  online at https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta.
