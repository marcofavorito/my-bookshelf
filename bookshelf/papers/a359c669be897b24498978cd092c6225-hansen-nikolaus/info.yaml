abstract: This tutorial introduces the CMA Evolution Strategy (ES), where CMA stands
  for Covariance Matrix Adaptation. The CMA-ES is a stochastic, or randomized, method
  for real-parameter (continuous domain) optimization of non-linear, non-convex functions.
  We try to motivate and derive the algorithm from intuitive concepts and from requirements
  of non-linear, non-convex search in continuous domain.
