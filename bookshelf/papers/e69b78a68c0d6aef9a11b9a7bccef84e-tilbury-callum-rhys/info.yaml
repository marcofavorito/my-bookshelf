abstract: Agent-based computational economics is a field with a rich academic history,
  yet one which has struggled to enter mainstream policy design toolboxes, plagued
  by the challenges associated with representing a complex and dynamic reality. The
  field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), too, has a rich history, and has recently
  been at the centre of several exponential developments. Modern RL implementations
  have been able to achieve unprecedented levels of sophistication, handling previously
  unthinkable degrees of complexity. This review surveys the historical barriers of
  classical agent-based techniques in economic modelling, and contemplates whether
  recent developments in RL can overcome any of them.
