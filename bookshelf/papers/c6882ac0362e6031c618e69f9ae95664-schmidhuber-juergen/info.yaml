abstract: In 2020-2021, we are celebrating that many of the basic ideas behind the
  deep learning revolution were published three decades ago within fewer than 12 months
  in our "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miraculous Year" 1990-1991 at TU Munich. Back then,
  few people were interested, but a quarter century later, neural networks based on
  these ideas were on over 3 billion devices such as smartphones, and used many billions
  of times per day, consuming a significant fraction of the world's compute.
