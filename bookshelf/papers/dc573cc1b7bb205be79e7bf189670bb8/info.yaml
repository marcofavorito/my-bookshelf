abstract: '<jats:p>(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics
  is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account
  for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every
  population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of
  the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present
  investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and
  Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried
  to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense
  more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person
  is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease
  in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact
  infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally
  is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances
  of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The
  chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent
  upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected
  members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short
  compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining
  constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease
  itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important
  probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when
  no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors
  of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible
  individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat
  this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion
  will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially
  equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete
  immunity is conferred by a single infection.</jats:p>'
