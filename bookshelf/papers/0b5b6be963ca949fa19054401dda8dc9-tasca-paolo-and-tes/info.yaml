abstract: <jats:p>A comparative study across the most widely known blockchain technologies
  is conducted with a bottom-up approach. Blockchains are deconstructed into their
  building blocks. Each building block is then hierarchically classified into main
  and subcomponents. Then, varieties of the subcomponents are identified and compared.
  A taxonomy tree is used to summarise the study and provide a navigation tool across
  different blockchain architectural configurations.</jats:p>
