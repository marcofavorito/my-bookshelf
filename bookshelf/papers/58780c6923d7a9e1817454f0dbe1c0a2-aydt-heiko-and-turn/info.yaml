abstract: Symbiotic simulation is a paradigm in which a simulation system and a physical
  system are closely associated with each other. This close relationship can be mutually
  beneficial. The simulation system benefits from real-time measurements about the
  physical system which are provided by corresponding sensors. The physical system,
  on the other side, may benefit from the effects of decisions made by the simulation
  system. An important concept in symbiotic simulation is that of the what-if analysis
  process which is concerned with the evaluation of a number of what-if scenarios
  by means of simulation. Symbiotic simulation and related paradigms have become popular
  in recent years because of their ability to dynamically incorporate real-time sensor
  data. In this paper, we explain different types of symbiotic simulation and give
  an overview of the state of the art. In addition, we discuss common research issues
  that have to be addressed when working with symbiotic simulation. While some issues
  have been adequately addressed, there are still research issues that remain open.
