abstract: <jats:p>Standard models in economics stress the role of intelligent agents
  who maximize utility. However, there may be situations where constraints imposed
  by market institutions dominate strategic agent behavior. We use data from the London
  Stock Exchange to test a simple model in which minimally intelligent agents place
  orders to trade at random. The model treats the statistical mechanics of order placement,
  price formation, and the accumulation of revealed supply and demand within the context
  of the continuous double auction and yields simple laws relating order-arrival rates
  to statistical properties of the market. We test the validity of these laws in explaining
  cross-sectional variation for 11 stocks. The model explains 96% of the variance
  of the gap between the best buying and selling prices (the spread) and 76% of the
  variance of the price diffusion rate, with only one free parameter. We also study
  the market impact function, describing the response of quoted prices to the arrival
  of new orders. The nondimensional coordinates dictated by the model approximately
  collapse data from different stocks onto a single curve. This work is important
  from a practical point of view, because it demonstrates the existence of simple
  laws relating prices to order flows and, in a broader context, suggests there are
  circumstances where the strategic behavior of agents may be dominated by other considerations.</jats:p>
