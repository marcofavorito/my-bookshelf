abstract: I am currently experimenting with various hash table algorithms, and I stumbled
  upon an approach called hopscotch hashing. Hopscotch hashing is a reordering scheme
  that can be used with the open addressing method for collision resolution in hash
  tables. When using open addressing with only a probing sequence and no reordering,
  entries are inserted in
