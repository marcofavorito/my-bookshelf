abstract: 'Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are used in several fields to study the evolution
  of complex systems from micro-level assumptions. However, ABMs typically can not
  estimate agent-specific (or "micro") variables: this is a major limitation which
  prevents ABMs from harnessing micro-level data availability and which greatly limits
  their predictive power. In this paper, we propose a protocol to learn the latent
  micro-variables of an ABM from data. The first step of our protocol is to reduce
  an ABM to a probabilistic model, characterized by a computationally tractable likelihood.
  This reduction follows two general design principles: balance of stochasticity and
  data availability, and replacement of unobservable discrete choices with differentiable
  approximations. Then, our protocol proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the
  latent variables via a gradient-based expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate
  our protocol by applying it to an ABM of the housing market, in which agents with
  different incomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. We demonstrate
  that the obtained model allows accurate estimates of the latent variables, while
  preserving the general behavior of the ABM. We also show that our estimates can
  be used for out-of-sample forecasting. Our protocol can be seen as an alternative
  to black-box data assimilation methods, that forces the modeler to lay bare the
  assumptions of the model, to think about the inferential process, and to spot potential
  identification problems.'
