abstract: How can complexity theory and algorithms benefit from practical advances
  in computing? We give a short overview of some prior work using practical computing
  to attack problems in computational complexity and algorithms, informally describe
  how linear program solvers may be used to help prove new lower bounds for satisfiability,
  and suggest a research program for developing new understanding in circuit complexity.
