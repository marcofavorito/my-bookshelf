abstract: 'When teaching formal methods, I often get asked how we can connect the
  specifications we write to the code we produce. One way we do this is with refinement.
  All examples are in TLA+.1

  Imagine we’re designing a multithreaded counter. We don’t know how we’re going to
  implement it yet, so we start by specifying the abstract behavior.2

  ---- MODULE abstract ---- EXTENDS Integers, Sequences VARIABLES pc, counter vars
  == {\textless}{\textless}pc, counter{\textgreater}{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}*
  Two threads Threads == 1.'
