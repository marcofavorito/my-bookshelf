abstract: 'On October 14th, 2020, researchers from OpenAI, the Stanford Institute
  for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and other universities convened to discuss
  open research questions surrounding GPT-3, the largest publicly-disclosed dense
  language model at the time. The meeting took place under Chatham House Rules. Discussants
  came from a variety of research backgrounds including computer science, linguistics,
  philosophy, political science, communications, cyber policy, and more. Broadly,
  the discussion centered around two main questions: 1) What are the technical capabilities
  and limitations of large language models? 2) What are the societal effects of widespread
  use of large language models? Here, we provide a detailed summary of the discussion
  organized by the two themes above.'
