abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) highlight the importance of simulation validation,
  such as qualitative face validation and quantitative empirical validation. In particular,
  we focused on quantitative validation by adjusting simulation input parameters of
  the ABM. This study introduces an automatic calibration framework that combines
  the suggested dynamic and heterogeneous calibration methods. Specifically, the dynamic
  calibration fits the simulation results to the real-world data by automatically
  capturing suitable simulation time to adjust the simulation parameters. Meanwhile,
  the heterogeneous calibration reduces the distributional discrepancy between individuals
  in the simulation and the real world by adjusting agent related parameters cluster-wisely.
