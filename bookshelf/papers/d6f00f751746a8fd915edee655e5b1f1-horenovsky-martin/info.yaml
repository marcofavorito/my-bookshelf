abstract: The previous post in this series was a quick introduction to the world of
  SAT and SAT solvers. In this post, we will convert a harder real-world problem,
  namely \_master-key system\_, into SAT and explore some of the more advanced techniques
  used to efficiently convert problems to SAT.
