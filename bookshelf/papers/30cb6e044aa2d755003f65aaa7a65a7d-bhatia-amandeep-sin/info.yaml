abstract: 'Quantum computing is concerned with computer technology based on the principles
  of quantum mechanics, with operations performed at the quantum level. Quantum computational
  models make it possible to analyze the resources required for computations. Quantum
  automata can be classified thusly: quantum finite automata, quantum sequential machine,
  quantum pushdown automata, quantum Turing machine and orthomodular lattice-valued
  automata. These models are useful for determining the expressive power and boundaries
  of various computational features. In light of the current state of quantum computation
  theory research, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article
  seeks to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of quantum finite automata
  models, quantum finite automata models with density operators and quantum finite
  automata models with classical states, interactive proof systems, quantum communication
  complexity and query complexity as described in the literature. The statistics of
  quantum finite automata related papers are shown and open problems are identified
  for more advanced research. The current status of quantum automata theory is distributed
  into various categories. This research work also highlights the previous research,
  current status and future directions of quantum automata models.'
