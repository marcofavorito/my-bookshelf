abstract: 'Over the past years, there has been a resurgence of Datalog-based systems
  in the database

  community as well as in industry. In this context, it has been recognized that to

  handle the complex knowledge-based scenarios encountered today, such as reasoning

  over large knowledge graphs, Datalog has to be extended with features such as existential

  quantification. Yet, Datalog-based reasoning in the presence of existential quantification

  is in general undecidable. Many efforts have been made to define decidable fragments.

  Warded Datalog+/- is a very promising one, as it captures PTIME complexity while
  allowing

  ontological reasoning. Yet so far, no implementation of Warded Datalog+/- was available.

  In this paper we present the Vadalog system, a Datalog-based system for performing

  complex logic reasoning tasks, such as those required in advanced knowledge graphs.

  The Vadalog system is Oxford''s contribution to the VADA research programme, a joint

  effort of the universities of Oxford, Manchester and Edinburgh and around 20 industrial

  partners. As the main contribution of this paper, we illustrate the first implementation

  of Warded Datalog+/-, a high-performance Datalog+/- system utilizing an aggressive

  termination control strategy. We also provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation.'
