abstract: '<jats:p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved significant results
  in many machine learning (ML) benchmarks. In this short survey, we provide an overview
  of DRL applied to trading on financial markets with the purpose of unravelling common
  structures used in the trading community using DRL, as well as discovering common
  issues and limitations of such approaches. We include also a short corpus summarization
  using Google Scholar. Moreover, we discuss how one can use hierarchy for dividing
  the problem space, as well as using model-based RL to learn a world model of the
  trading environment which can be used for prediction. In addition, multiple risk
  measures are defined and discussed, which not only provide a way of quantifying
  the performance of various algorithms, but they can also act as (dense) reward-shaping
  mechanisms for the agent. We discuss in detail the various state representations
  used for financial markets, which we consider critical for the success and efficiency
  of such DRL agents. The market in focus for this survey is the cryptocurrency market;
  the results of this survey are two-fold: firstly, to find the most promising directions
  for further research and secondly, to show how a lack of consistency in the community
  can significantly impede research and the development of DRL agents for trading.</jats:p>'
