abstract: Recent developments in the field of model-based RL have proven successful
  in a range of environments, especially ones where planning is essential. However,
  such successes have been limited to deterministic fully-observed environments. We
  present a new approach that handles stochastic and partially-observable environments.
  Our key insight is to use discrete autoencoders to capture the multiple possible
  effects of an action in a stochastic environment. We use a stochastic variant of
  Monte Carlo tree search to plan over both the agent's actions and the discrete latent
  variables representing the environment's response. Our approach significantly outperforms
  an offline version of MuZero on a stochastic interpretation of chess where the opponent
  is considered part of the environment. We also show that our approach scales to
  DeepMind Lab, a first-person 3D environment with large visual observations and partial
  observability.
