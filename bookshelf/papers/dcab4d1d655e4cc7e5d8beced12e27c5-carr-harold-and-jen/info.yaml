abstract: LibraBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol based on
  HotStuff. We present an abstract model of the protocol underlying HotStuff / LibraBFT,
  and formal, machine-checked proofs of their core correctness (safety) property and
  an extended condition that enables non-participating parties to verify committed
  results. (Liveness properties would be proved for specific implementations, not
  for the abstract model presented in this paper.)   A key contribution is precisely
  defining assumptions about the behavior of honest peers, in an abstract way, independent
  of any particular implementation. Therefore, our work is an important step towards
  proving correctness of an entire class of concrete implementations, without repeating
  the hard work of proving correctness of the underlying protocol. The abstract proofs
  are for a single configuration (epoch); extending these proofs across configuration
  changes is future work. Our models and proofs are expressed in Agda, and are available
  in open source.
