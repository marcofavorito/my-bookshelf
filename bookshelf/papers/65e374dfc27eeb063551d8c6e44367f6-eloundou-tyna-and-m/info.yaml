abstract: We investigate the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer
  (GPT) models and related technologies on the U.S. labor market. Using a new rubric,
  we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating
  both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that
  approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks
  affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least
  50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income
  jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to
  industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude that Generative Pre-trained
  Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting
  that as these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.
