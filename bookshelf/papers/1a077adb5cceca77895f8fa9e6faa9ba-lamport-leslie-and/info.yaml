abstract: Auxiliary variables are often needed for verifying that an implementation
  is correct with respect to a higher-level specification. They augment the formal
  description of the implementation without changing its semantics--that is, the set
  of behaviors that it describes. This paper explains rules for adding history, prophecy,
  and stuttering variables to TLA+ specifications, ensuring that the augmented specification
  is equivalent to the original one. The rules are explained with toy examples, and
  they are used to verify the correctness of a simplified version of a snapshot algorithm
  due to Afek et al.
