abstract: In this work, we introduce Boolformer, the first Transformer architecture
  trained to perform end-to-end symbolic regression of Boolean functions. First, we
  show that it can predict compact formulas for complex functions which were not seen
  during training, when provided a clean truth table. Then, we demonstrate its ability
  to find approximate expressions when provided incomplete and noisy observations.
  We evaluate the Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets,
  demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning
  methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modelling the dynamics of
  gene regulatory networks. Using a recent benchmark, we show that Boolformer is competitive
  with state-of-the art genetic algorithms with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.
  Our code and models are available publicly.
