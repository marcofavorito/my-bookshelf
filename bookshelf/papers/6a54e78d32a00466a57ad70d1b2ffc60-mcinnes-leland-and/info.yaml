abstract: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold
  learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical
  framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical
  scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive
  with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global
  structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational
  restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension
  reduction technique for machine learning.
