abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a novel area of AI research which
  seeks to combine traditional rules-based AI approaches with modern deep learning
  techniques. Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform
  state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning.
  They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training
  data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative
  sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are
  not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics
  of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential
  parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity
  operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural
  aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly
  separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does
  in many ML workloads.
