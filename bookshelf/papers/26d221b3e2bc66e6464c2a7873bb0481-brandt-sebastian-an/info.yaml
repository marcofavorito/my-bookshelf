  We propose a novel framework for ontology-based access to temporal log data using
  a datalog extension datalogMTL of the Horn fragment of the metric temporal logic
  MTL. We show that datalogMTL is EXPSPACE-complete even with punctual intervals,
  in which case full MTL is known to be undecidable. We also prove that nonrecursive
  datalogMTL is PSPACE-complete for combined complexity and in AC0 for data complexity.
  We demonstrate by two real-world use cases that nonrecursive datalogMTL programs
  can express complex temporal concepts from typical user queries and thereby facilitate
  access to temporal log data. Our experiments with Siemens turbine data and MesoWest
  weather data show that datalogMTL ontology-mediated queries are efficient and scale
  on large datasets.&#x0D;
