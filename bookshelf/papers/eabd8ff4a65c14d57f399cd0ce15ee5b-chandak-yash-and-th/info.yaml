abstract: 'In many real-world sequential decision making problems, the number of available
  actions (decisions) can vary over time. While problems like catastrophic forgetting,
  changing transition dynamics, changing rewards functions, etc. have been well-studied
  in the lifelong learning literature, the setting where the action set changes remains
  unaddressed. In this paper, we present an algorithm that autonomously adapts to
  an action set whose size changes over time. To tackle this open problem, we break
  it into two problems that can be solved iteratively: inferring the underlying, unknown,
  structure in the space of actions and optimizing a policy that leverages this structure.
  We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on large-scale real-world lifelong
  learning problems.'
