abstract: We present an extension to the $\mathtt{mathlib}$ library of the Lean theorem
  prover formalizing the foundations of computability theory. We use primitive recursive
  functions and partial recursive functions as the main objects of study, and we use
  a constructive encoding of partial functions such that they are executable when
  the programs in question provably halt. Main theorems include the construction of
  a universal partial recursive function and a proof of the undecidability of the
  halting problem. Type class inference provides a transparent way to supply G\"{o}del
  numberings where needed and encapsulate the encoding details.
