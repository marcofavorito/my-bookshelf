abstract: This paper illustrates the use of the nonparametric Wald-Wolfowitz test
  to detect stationarity and ergodicity in agent-based models. A nonparametric test
  is needed due to the practical impossibility to understand how the random component
  influences the emergent properties of the model in many agent-based models. Nonparametric
  tests on real data often lack power and this problem is addressed by applying the
  Wald-Wolfowitz test to the simulated data. The performance of the tests is evaluated
  using Monte Carlo simulations of a stochastic process with known properties. It
  is shown that with appropriate settings the tests can detect non-stationarity and
  non-ergodicity. Knowing whether a model is ergodic and stationary is essential in
  order to understand its behavior and the real system it is intended to represent;
  quantitative analysis of the artificial data helps to acquire such knowledge.
