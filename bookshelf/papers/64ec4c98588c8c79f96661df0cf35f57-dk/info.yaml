abstract: Have you ever asked yourself how the inventions, gadgets, and devices that
  surround us actually work? Discover the hidden workings of everyday technology with
  this graphic guide.How Technology Works demystifies the machinery that keeps the
  modern world going, from simple objects such as zip fasteners and can openers to
  the latest, most sophisticated devices of the information age, including smartwatches,
  personal digital assistants, and driverless cars. It includes inventions that have
  changed the course of history, like the internal combustion engine, as well as technologies
  that might hold the key to our future survival, including solar cells and new kinds
  of farming to feed a growing population. Throughout the book, step-by-step explanations
  are supported by simple and original graphics that take devices apart and show you
  how they work. The opening chapter explains principles that underpin lots of devices,
  from basic mechanics to electricity to digital technology. From there, devices are
  grouped by application--such as the home, transportation, and computing--making
  them easy to find and placing similar devices side by side. How Technology Works
  is perfect for anyone who didn't have training in STEM subjects at school or is
  simply curious about how the modern world works.
