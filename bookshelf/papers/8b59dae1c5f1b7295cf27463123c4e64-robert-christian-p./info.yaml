abstract: The book A Treatise on Probability was published by John Maynard Keynes
  in 1921. It contains a critical assessment of the foundations of probability and
  of the current statistical methodology. As a modern reader, we review here the aspects
  that are most related with statistics, avoiding a neophyte's perspective on the
  philosophical issues. In particular, the book is quite critical of the Bayesian
  approach and we examine the arguments provided by Keynes, as well as the alternative
  he proposes. This review does not subsume the scholarly study of Aldrich (2008a)
  relating Keynes with the statistics community of the time.
