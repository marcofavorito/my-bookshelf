abstract: Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide
  range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level,
  given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence
  in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these models with language
  instructions or examples, to implement a variety of downstream tasks. Advanced prompting
  methods can even imply interaction between the language model, a user, and external
  tools such as calculators. However, to obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt
  language models for specific tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have
  to be implemented, which may still require ad-hoc interaction.   Based on this,
  we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP). LMP generalizes language
  model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive combination of text prompting
  and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows constraints to be specified over the language
  model output. This enables easy adaption to many tasks, while abstracting language
  model internals and providing high-level semantics. To enable LMP, we implement
  LMQL (short for Language Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints
  and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure
  that minimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model. We
  show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods in
  an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are challenging
  to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that we retain
  or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also significantly reducing
  the required amount of computation or cost in the case of pay-to-use APIs (13-85%
  cost savings).
