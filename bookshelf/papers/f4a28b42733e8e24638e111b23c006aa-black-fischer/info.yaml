abstract: <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of noise on the world,
  and on our views of the world, are profound. Noise in the sense of a large number
  of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number
  of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus
  allows us to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat
  inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Noise
  in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business
  cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention.
  Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation
  to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates.
  Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other
  exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation
  rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity. Most generally,
  noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about
  the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in
  the dark.</jats:p>
