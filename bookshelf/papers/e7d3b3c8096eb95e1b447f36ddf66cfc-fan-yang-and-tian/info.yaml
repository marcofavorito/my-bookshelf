abstract: 'Teaching plays a very important role in our society, by spreading human
  knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select appropriate
  teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations,
  according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial
  intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the role of teaching, and pays
  most attention to machine \emph{learning}. In this paper, we argue that equal attention,
  if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework
  (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call
  this approach `learning to teach''. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact
  with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional
  machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate
  data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student
  model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize
  its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve
  teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed
  approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and
  show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able to use much less
  training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different
  kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks
  and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image
  classification and text understanding).'
