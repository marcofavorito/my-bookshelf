abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize
  research in economics and other disciplines. I describe 25 use cases along six domains
  in which LLMs are starting to become useful as both research assistants and tutors:
  ideation, writing, background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical
  derivations. I provide general instructions and demonstrate specific examples for
  how to take advantage of each of these, classifying the LLM capabilities from experimental
  to highly useful. I hypothesize that ongoing advances will improve the performance
  of LLMs across all of these domains, and that economic researchers who take advantage
  of LLMs to automate micro tasks will become significantly more productive. Finally,
  I speculate on the longer-term implications of cognitive automation via LLMs for
  economic research.'
