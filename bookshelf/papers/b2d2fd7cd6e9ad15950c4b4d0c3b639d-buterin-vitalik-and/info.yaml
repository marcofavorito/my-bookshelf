abstract: We present "Gasper," a proof-of-stake-based consensus protocol, which is
  an idealized version of the proposed Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain. The protocol combines
  Casper FFG, a finality tool, with LMD GHOST, a fork-choice rule. We prove safety,
  plausible liveness, and probabilistic liveness under different sets of assumptions.
