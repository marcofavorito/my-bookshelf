abstract: 'In this paper, we apply machine learning to distributed private data owned
  by multiple data owners, entities with access to non-overlapping training datasets.
  We use noisy, differentially-private gradients to minimize the fitness cost of the
  machine learning model using stochastic gradient descent. We quantify the quality
  of the trained model, using the fitness cost, as a function of privacy budget and
  size of the distributed datasets to capture the trade-off between privacy and utility
  in machine learning. This way, we can predict the outcome of collaboration among
  privacy-aware data owners prior to executing potentially computationally-expensive
  machine learning algorithms. Particularly, we show that the difference between the
  fitness of the trained machine learning model using differentially-private gradient
  queries and the fitness of the trained machine model in the absence of any privacy
  concerns is inversely proportional to the size of the training datasets squared
  and the privacy budget squared. We successfully validate the performance prediction
  with the actual performance of the proposed privacy-aware learning algorithms, applied
  to: financial datasets for determining interest rates of loans using regression;
  and detecting credit card frauds using support vector machines.'
