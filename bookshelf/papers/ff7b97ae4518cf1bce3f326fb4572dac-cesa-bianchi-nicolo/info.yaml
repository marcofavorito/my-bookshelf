abstract: 'Bilateral trade, a fundamental topic in economics, models the problem of
  intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade
  a good for which they hold private valuations. Despite the simplicity of this problem,
  a classical result by Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) affirms the impossibility
  of designing a mechanism which is simultaneously efficient, incentive compatible,
  individually rational, and budget balanced. This impossibility result fostered an
  intense investigation of meaningful trade-offs between these desired properties.
  Much work has focused on approximately efficient fixed-price mechanisms, i.e., Blumrosen
  and Dobzinski (2014; 2016), Colini-Baldeschi et al. (2016), which have been shown
  to fully characterize strong budget balanced and ex-post individually rational direct
  revelation mechanisms. All these results, however, either assume some knowledge
  on the priors of the seller/buyer valuations, or a black box access to some samples
  of the distributions, as in D{\"u}tting et al. (2021). In this paper, we cast for
  the first time the bilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework over
  rounds of seller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on the private seller/buyer
  valuations. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the regret regimes
  for fixed-price mechanisms with different models of feedback and private valuations,
  using as benchmark the best fixed price in hindsight. More precisely, we prove the
  following bounds on the regret:   $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback
  (i.e., direct revelation mechanisms);   $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$
  for realistic feedback (i.e., posted-price mechanisms) and independent seller/buyer
  valuations with bounded densities;   $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback
  and seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities;   $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for
  realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer valuations;   $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$
  for the adversarial setting.'
