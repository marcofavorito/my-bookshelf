abstract: Planning as theorem proving in situation calculus was abandoned 50 years
  ago as an impossible project. But we have developed a Theorem Proving Lifted Heuristic
  (TPLH) planner that searches for a plan in a tree of situations using the A* search
  algorithm. It is controlled by a delete relaxation-based domain independent heuristic.
  We compare TPLH with Fast Downward (FD) and Best First Width Search (BFWS) planners
  over several standard benchmarks. Since our implementation of the heuristic function
  is not optimized, TPLH is slower than FD and BFWS. But it computes shorter plans,
  and it explores fewer states. We discuss previous research on planning within KR\&R
  and identify related directions. Thus, we show that deductive lifted heuristic planning
  in situation calculus is actually doable.
