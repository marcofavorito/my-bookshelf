abstract: We show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem and the related problems
  of String Isomorphism (under group action) (SI) and Coset Intersection (CI) can
  be solved in quasipolynomial ($\exp((\log n)^{O(1)})$) time. The best previous bound
  for GI was $\exp(O(\sqrt{n\log n}))$, where $n$ is the number of vertices (Luks,
  1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, $\exp(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}))$,
  where $n$ is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983).   The algorithm builds
  on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm
  by group theoretic "local certificates" and combinatorial canonical partitioning
  techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions
  to effective canonical partitioning.   Luks's barrier situation is characterized
  by a homomorphism {\phi} that maps a given permutation group $G$ onto $S_k$ or $A_k$,
  the symmetric or alternating group of degree $k$, where $k$ is not too small. We
  say that an element $x$ in the permutation domain on which $G$ acts is affected
  by {\phi} if the {\phi}-image of the stabilizer of $x$ does not contain $A_k$. The
  affected/unaffected dichotomy underlies the core "local certificates" routine and
  is the central divide-and-conquer tool of the algorithm.
