abstract: This paper presents a brief, semi-technical comparison of the essential
  features of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference, with
  several illustrative examples implemented in Python. The differences between frequentism
  and Bayesianism fundamentally stem from differing definitions of probability, a
  philosophical divide which leads to distinct approaches to the solution of statistical
  problems as well as contrasting ways of asking and answering questions about unknown
  parameters. After an example-driven discussion of these differences, we briefly
  compare several leading Python statistical packages which implement frequentist
  inference using classical methods and Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo.
