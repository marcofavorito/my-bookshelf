abstract: Existing studies in black-box optimization for machine learning suffer from
  low generalizability, caused by a typically selective choice of problem instances
  used for training and testing different optimization algorithms. Among other issues,
  this practice promotes overfitting and poor-performing user guidelines. To address
  this shortcoming, we propose in this work a benchmark suite, OptimSuite, which covers
  a broad range of black-box optimization problems, ranging from academic benchmarks
  to real-world applications, from discrete over numerical to mixed-integer problems,
  from small to very large-scale problems, from noisy over dynamic to static problems,
  etc. We demonstrate the advantages of such a broad collection by deriving from it
  Automated Black Box Optimizer (ABBO), a general-purpose algorithm selection wizard.
  Using three different types of algorithm selection techniques, ABBO achieves competitive
  performance on all benchmark suites. It significantly outperforms previous state
  of the art on some of them, including YABBOB and LSGO. ABBO relies on many high-quality
  base components. Its excellent performance is obtained without any task-specific
  parametrization.   The OptimSuite benchmark collection, the ABBO wizard and its
  base solvers have all been merged into the open-source Nevergrad platform, where
  they are available for reproducible research.
