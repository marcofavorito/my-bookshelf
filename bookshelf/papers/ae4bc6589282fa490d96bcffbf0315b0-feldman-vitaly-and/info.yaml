abstract: 'We prove the following strong hardness result for learning: Given a distribution
  of labeled examples from the hypercube such that there exists a monomial consistent
  with $(1-\eps)$ of the examples, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that is correct
  on $(1/2+\eps)$ of the examples, for arbitrary constants $\eps > 0$. In learning
  theory terms, weak agnostic learning of monomials is hard, even if one is allowed
  to output a hypothesis from the much bigger concept class of halfspaces. This hardness
  result subsumes a long line of previous results, including two recent hardness results
  for the proper learning of monomials and halfspaces. As an immediate corollary of
  our result we show that weak agnostic learning of decision lists is NP-hard.   Our
  techniques are quite different from previous hardness proofs for learning. We define
  distributions on positive and negative examples for monomials whose first few moments
  match. We use the invariance principle to argue that regular halfspaces (all of
  whose coefficients have small absolute value relative to the total $\ell_2$ norm)
  cannot distinguish between distributions whose first few moments match. For highly
  non-regular subspaces, we use a structural lemma from recent work on fooling halfspaces
  to argue that they are ``junta-like'''' and one can zero out all but the top few
  coefficients without affecting the performance of the halfspace. The top few coefficients
  form the natural list decoding of a halfspace in the context of dictatorship tests/Label
  Cover reductions.   We note that unlike previous invariance principle based proofs
  which are only known to give Unique-Games hardness, we are able to reduce from a
  version of Label Cover problem that is known to be NP-hard. This has inspired follow-up
  work on bypassing the Unique Games conjecture in some optimal geometric inapproximability
  results.'
