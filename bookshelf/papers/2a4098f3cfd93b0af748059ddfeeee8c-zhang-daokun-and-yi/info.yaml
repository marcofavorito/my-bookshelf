abstract: With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks
  are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various
  disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, telecommunication networks,
  and biological networks. Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects
  of social life such as the structure of societies, information diffusion, and communication
  patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks often makes
  network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation
  learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network
  vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure,
  vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network
  to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey,
  we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation
  learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies
  to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning
  techniques according to the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information
  intended to preserve, as well as the algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize
  evaluation protocols used for validating network representation learning including
  published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and open source algorithms. We
  also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms
  on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we suggest
  promising research directions to facilitate future study.
