abstract: 'Bilateral trade, a fundamental topic in economics, models the problem of
  intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade
  a good for which they hold private valuations. In this paper, we cast the bilateral
  trade problem in a regret minimization framework over $T$ rounds of seller/buyer
  interactions, with no prior knowledge on their private valuations. Our main contribution
  is a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms
  with different feedback models and private valuations, using as a benchmark the
  best fixed-price in hindsight. More precisely, we prove the following tight bounds
  on the regret:   - $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback (i.e., direct revelation
  mechanisms).   - $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ for realistic feedback (i.e., posted-price mechanisms)
  and independent seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities.   - $\Theta(T)$
  for realistic feedback and seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities.   - $\Theta(T)$
  for realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer valuations.   - $\Theta(T)$
  for the adversarial setting.'
