abstract: 'Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications constitute an entire financial
  ecosystem deployed on blockchains. Such applications are based on complex protocols
  and incentive mechanisms whose financial safety is hard to determine. Besides, their
  adoption is rapidly growing, hence imperilling an increasingly higher amount of
  assets. Therefore, accurate formalisation and verification of DeFi applications
  is essential to assess their safety. We present a tool for the formal analysis of
  one of the most widespread DeFi applications: Lending Pools (LP). This was achieved
  by leveraging an existing formal model for LPs, the Maude verification environment
  and the MultiVeStA statistical analyser. The tool supports several analyses including
  reachability analysis, LTL model checking and statistical model checking. We show
  how the tool can be used to statistically analyse several parameters of LPs that
  are fundamental to assess and predict their behaviour.'
