abstract: The growing number of applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world
  domains has led to the development of privacy-preserving techniques due to the inherently
  sensitive nature of data. Most existing works focus on differential privacy, in
  which information is revealed in the clear to an agent whose learned model should
  be robust against information leakage to malicious third parties. Motivated by use
  cases in which only encrypted data might be shared, such as information from sensitive
  sites, in this work we consider scenarios in which the inputs themselves are sensitive
  and cannot be revealed. We develop a simple extension to the MDP framework which
  provides for the encryption of states. We present a preliminary, experimental study
  of how a DQN agent trained on encrypted states performs in environments with discrete
  and continuous state spaces. Our results highlight that the agent is still capable
  of learning in small state spaces even in presence of non-deterministic encryption,
  but performance collapses in more complex environments.
