abstract: In recent years, methods of approximate parameter estimation have attracted
  considerable interest in complex problems where exact likelihoods are hard to obtain.
  In their most basic form, Bayesian methods such as Approximate Bayesian Computation
  (ABC) involve sampling from the parameter space and keeping those parameters that
  produce data that fit sufficiently well to the actually observed data. Exploring
  the whole parameter space, however, makes this approach inefficient in high dimensional
  problems. This led to the proposal of more sophisticated iterative methods of inference
  such as particle filters.   Here, we propose an alternative approach that is based
  on stochastic gradient methods and applicable both in a frequentist and a Bayesian
  setting. By moving along a simulated gradient, the algorithm produces a sequence
  of estimates that will eventually converge either to the maximum likelihood estimate
  or to the maximum of the posterior distribution, in each case under a set of observed
  summary statistics. To avoid reaching only a local maximum, we propose to run the
  algorithm from a set of random starting values.   As good tuning of the algorithm
  is important, we explored several tuning strategies, and propose a set of guidelines
  that worked best in our simulations. We investigate the performance of our approach
  in simulation studies, and also apply the algorithm to two models with intractable
  likelihood functions. First, we present an application to inference in the context
  of queuing systems. We also re-analyze population genetic data and estimate parameters
  describing the demographic history of Sumatran and Bornean orang-utan populations.
