abstract: The marvel of markets lies in the fact that dispersed information is instantaneously
  processed and used to adjust the price of goods, services and assets. Financial
  markets are particularly efficient when it comes to processing information; such
  information is typically embedded in textual news that is then interpreted by investors.
  Quite recently, researchers have started to automatically determine news sentiment
  in order to explain stock price movements. Interestingly, this so-called news sentiment
  works fairly well in explaining stock returns. In this paper, we design trading
  strategies that utilize textual news in order to obtain profits on the basis of
  novel information entering the market. We thus propose approaches for automated
  decision-making based on supervised and reinforcement learning. Altogether, we demonstrate
  how news-based data can be incorporated into an investment system.
