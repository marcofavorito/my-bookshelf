abstract: We introduce Meta-F*, a tactics and metaprogramming framework for the F*
  program verifier. The main novelty of Meta-F* is allowing the use of tactics and
  metaprogramming to discharge assertions not solvable by SMT, or to just simplify
  them into well-behaved SMT fragments. Plus, Meta-F* can be used to generate verified
  code automatically.   Meta-F* is implemented as an F* effect, which, given the powerful
  effect system of F*, heavily increases code reuse and even enables the lightweight
  verification of metaprograms. Metaprograms can be either interpreted, or compiled
  to efficient native code that can be dynamically loaded into the F* type-checker
  and can interoperate with interpreted code. Evaluation on realistic case studies
  shows that Meta-F* provides substantial gains in proof development, efficiency,
  and robustness.
