abstract: Following the recent successful examples of large technology companies,
  many modern enterprises seek to build knowledge graphs to provide a unified view
  of corporate knowledge and to draw deep insights using machine learning and logical
  reasoning. There is currently a perceived disconnect between the traditional approaches
  for data science, typically based on machine learning and statistical modelling,
  and systems for reasoning with domain knowledge. In this paper we present a state-of-the-art
  Knowledge Graph Management System, Vadalog, which delivers highly expressive and
  efficient logical reasoning and provides seamless integration with modern data science
  toolkits, such as the Jupyter platform. We demonstrate how to use Vadalog to perform
  traditional data wrangling tasks, as well as complex logical and probabilistic reasoning.
  We argue that this is a significant step forward towards combining machine learning
  and reasoning in data science.
