abstract: The success of modern deep learning hinges on the ability to train neural
  networks at scale. Through clever reuse of intermediate information, backpropagation
  facilitates training through gradient computation at a total cost roughly proportional
  to running the function, rather than incurring an additional factor proportional
  to the number of parameters - which can now be in the trillions. Naively, one expects
  that quantum measurement collapse entirely rules out the reuse of quantum information
  as in backpropagation. But recent developments in shadow tomography, which assumes
  access to multiple copies of a quantum state, have challenged that notion. Here,
  we investigate whether parameterized quantum models can train as efficiently as
  classical neural networks. We show that achieving backpropagation scaling is impossible
  without access to multiple copies of a state. With this added ability, we introduce
  an algorithm with foundations in shadow tomography that matches backpropagation
  scaling in quantum resources while reducing classical auxiliary computational costs
  to open problems in shadow tomography. These results highlight the nuance of reusing
  quantum information for practical purposes and clarify the unique difficulties in
  training large quantum models, which could alter the course of quantum machine learning.
