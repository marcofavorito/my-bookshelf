abstract: The unification of logic and probability is a long-standing concern in AI,
  and more generally, in the philosophy of science. In essence, logic provides an
  easy way to specify properties that must hold in every possible world, and probability
  allows us to further quantify the weight and ratio of the worlds that must satisfy
  a property. To that end, numerous developments have been undertaken, culminating
  in proposals such as probabilistic relational models. While this progress has been
  notable, a general-purpose first-order knowledge representation language to reason
  about probabilities and dynamics, including in continuous settings, is still to
  emerge. In this paper, we survey recent results pertaining to the integration of
  logic, probability and actions in the situation calculus, which is arguably one
  of the oldest and most well-known formalisms. We then explore reduction theorems
  and programming interfaces for the language. These results are motivated in the
  context of cognitive robotics (as envisioned by Reiter and his colleagues) for the
  sake of concreteness. Overall, the advantage of proving results for such a general
  language is that it becomes possible to adapt them to any special-purpose fragment,
  including but not limited to popular probabilistic relational models.
