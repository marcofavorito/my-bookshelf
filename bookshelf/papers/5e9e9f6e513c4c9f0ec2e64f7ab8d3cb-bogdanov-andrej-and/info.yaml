abstract: We survey the average-case complexity of problems in NP.   We discuss various
  notions of good-on-average algorithms, and present completeness results due to Impagliazzo
  and Levin. Such completeness results establish the fact that if a certain specific
  (but somewhat artificial) NP problem is easy-on-average with respect to the uniform
  distribution, then all problems in NP are easy-on-average with respect to all samplable
  distributions. Applying the theory to natural distributional problems remain an
  outstanding open question. We review some natural distributional problems whose
  average-case complexity is of particular interest and that do not yet fit into this
  theory.   A major open question whether the existence of hard-on-average problems
  in NP can be based on the P$\neq$NP assumption or on related worst-case assumptions.
  We review negative results showing that certain proof techniques cannot prove such
  a result. While the relation between worst-case and average-case complexity for
  general NP problems remains open, there has been progress in understanding the relation
  between different "degrees" of average-case complexity. We discuss some of these
  "hardness amplification" results.
