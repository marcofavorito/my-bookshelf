abstract: 'We describe a modular rewriting system for translating optimization problems
  written in a domain-specific language to forms compatible with low-level solver
  interfaces. Translation is facilitated by reductions, which accept a category of
  problems and transform instances of that category to equivalent instances of another
  category. Our system proceeds in two key phases: analysis, in which we attempt to
  find a suitable solver for a supplied problem, and canonicalization, in which we
  rewrite the problem in the selected solver''s standard form. We implement the described
  system in version 1.0 of CVXPY, a domain-specific language for mathematical and
  especially convex optimization. By treating reductions as first-class objects, our
  method makes it easy to match problems to solvers well-suited for them and to support
  solvers with a wide variety of standard forms.'
