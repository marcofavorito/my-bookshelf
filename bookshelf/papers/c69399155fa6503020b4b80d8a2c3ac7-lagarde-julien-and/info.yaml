abstract: Our brains are viewed as interconnected distributed systems. The connections
  between distant areas in the brain are significantly delayed. How to obtained now
  in such networks with delayed interconnections? We aim to show that delayed communication
  and interconnectedness of the brain impose an interaction with the environment,
  assuming that such an access to now, which we label t-present, is of use for this
  system. It is conjectured that for any sensory, motor or cognitive functions to
  work efficiently an updated sort of time origin is required, and we claim that it
  is uniquely given by a direct contact with the physical environment. To get such
  contact autonomously any movement is required, be it originating in the motion of
  sensory systems or in goal directed movements. Some limit cases are identified and
  discussed. Next, several testable situations are envisioned and available studies
  in favor of the main theoretical hypothesis are shortly reviewed. Finally, as a
  proof of concept, an experimental study employing galvanic vestibular stimulation
  is presented and discussed.
