abstract: P-hacking is a well-understood cause of false positives in factor investing.
  A far less studied cause is factor model specification choices. We show how standard
  econometric practices induce factor researchers to make specification errors, and
  we prove sufficient conditions under which those specification errors explain the
  underperformance observed in popular factor investing strategies. Critically, these
  findings prove that, contrary to popular belief, factor strategies can underperform
  even if correlations remain constant and betas are estimated with the correct sign.
  To our knowledge, this is the first study that connects specification errors, factor
  model selection practices, and underperformance through a causal mechanism. These
  findings challenge the scientific soundness and long-term profitability of the current
  (associational, casual, non-causal) multi-trillion-dollar factor investing industry.
  To overcome these pitfalls, academics and practitioners should rebuild the financial
  economics literature on the more scientifically rigorous grounds of causal factor
  investing.
