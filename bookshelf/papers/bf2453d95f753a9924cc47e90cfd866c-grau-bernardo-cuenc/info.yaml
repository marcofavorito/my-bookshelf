abstract: Answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over a set of facts extended with existential
  rules is a prominent problem in knowledge representation and databases. This problem
  can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends the given set of facts with
  fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the chase terminates, then CQs can
  be evaluated directly in the resulting set of facts. The chase, however, does not
  terminate necessarily, and checking whether the chase terminates on a given set
  of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous acyclicity notions were proposed as
  sufficient conditions for chase termination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity
  notions called model-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity
  (MSA). Furthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions
  and establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that
  MFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.   Existential rules are closely related
  to the Horn fragments of the OWL 2 ontology language; furthermore, several prominent
  OWL 2 reasoners implement CQ answering by using the chase to materialise all relevant
  facts. In order to avoid termination problems, many of these systems handle only
  the OWL 2 RL profile of OWL 2; furthermore, some systems go beyond OWL 2 RL, but
  without any termination guarantees. In this paper we also investigate whether various
  acyclicity notions can provide a principled and practical solution to these problems.
  On the theoretical side, we show that query answering for acyclic ontologies is
  of lower complexity than for general ontologies. On the practical side, we show
  that many of the commonly used OWL 2 ontologies are MSA, and that the number of
  facts obtained by materialisation is not too large. Our results thus suggest that
  principled development of materialisation-based OWL 2 reasoners is practically feasible.
