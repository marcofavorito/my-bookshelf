abstract: 'Imprecise probability generalizes probability theory to allow for partial
  probability specifications, and is applicable when information is scarce, vague,
  or conflicting, in which case a unique probability distribution may be hard to identify.
  Thereby, the theory aims to represent the available knowledge more accurately.  Imprecision
  is useful for dealing with expert elicitation, because:


  People have a limited ability to determine their own subjective probabilities and
  might find that they can only provide an interval.

  As an interval is compatible with a range of opinions, the analysis ought to be
  more convincing to a range of different people.'
