abstract: 'Architects draw detailed plans before a brick is laid or a nail is hammered.
  But few programmers write even a rough sketch of what their programs will do before
  they start coding. Some may argue that the analogy between specifications and blueprints
  is flawed because programs aren’t like buildings: Tearing down walls is hard but
  changing code is easy. But changing code is hard — especially if we don’t want to
  introduce bugs.'
