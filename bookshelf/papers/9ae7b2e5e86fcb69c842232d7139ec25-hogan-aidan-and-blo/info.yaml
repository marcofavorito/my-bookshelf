abstract: In this paper we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs,
  which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and academia
  in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of
  data. After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data
  models and query languages that are used for knowledge graphs. We discuss the roles
  of schema, identity, and context in knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can
  be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques.
  We summarise methods for the creation, enrichment, quality assessment, refinement,
  and publication of knowledge graphs. We provide an overview of prominent open knowledge
  graphs and enterprise knowledge graphs, their applications, and how they use the
  aforementioned techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions
  for knowledge graphs.
