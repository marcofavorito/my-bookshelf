abstract: The inclusion of physical information in machine learning frameworks has
  revolutionized many application areas. This involves enhancing the learning process
  by incorporating physical constraints and adhering to physical laws. In this work
  we explore their utility for reinforcement learning applications. We present a thorough
  review of the literature on incorporating physics information, as known as physics
  priors, in reinforcement learning approaches, commonly referred to as physics-informed
  reinforcement learning (PIRL). We introduce a novel taxonomy with the reinforcement
  learning pipeline as the backbone to classify existing works, compare and contrast
  them, and derive crucial insights. Existing works are analyzed with regard to the
  representation/ form of the governing physics modeled for integration, their specific
  contribution to the typical reinforcement learning architecture, and their connection
  to the underlying reinforcement learning pipeline stages. We also identify core
  learning architectures and physics incorporation biases (i.e., observational, inductive
  and learning) of existing PIRL approaches and use them to further categorize the
  works for better understanding and adaptation. By providing a comprehensive perspective
  on the implementation of the physics-informed capability, the taxonomy presents
  a cohesive approach to PIRL. It identifies the areas where this approach has been
  applied, as well as the gaps and opportunities that exist. Additionally, the taxonomy
  sheds light on unresolved issues and challenges, which can guide future research.
  This nascent field holds great potential for enhancing reinforcement learning algorithms
  by increasing their physical plausibility, precision, data efficiency, and applicability
  in real-world scenarios.
