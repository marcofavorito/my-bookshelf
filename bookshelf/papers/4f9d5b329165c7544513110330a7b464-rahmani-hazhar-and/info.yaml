abstract: In this paper, we consider a temporal logic planning problem in which the
  objective is to find an infinite trajectory that satisfies an optimal selection
  from a set of soft specifications expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) while
  nevertheless satisfying a hard specification expressed in LTL. Our previous work
  considered a similar problem in which linear dynamic logic for finite traces (LDLf),
  rather than LTL, was used to express the soft constraints. In that work, LDLf was
  used to impose constraints on finite prefixes of the infinite trajectory. By using
  LTL, one is able not only to impose constraints on the finite prefixes of the trajectory,
  but also to set `soft' goals across the entirety of the infinite trajectory. Our
  algorithm first constructs a product automaton, on which the planning problem is
  reduced to computing a lasso with minimum cost. Among all such lassos, it is desirable
  to compute a shortest one. Though we prove that computing such a shortest lasso
  is computationally hard, we also introduce an efficient greedy approach to synthesize
  short lassos nonetheless. We present two case studies describing an implementation
  of this approach, and report results of our experiment comparing our greedy algorithm
  with an optimal baseline.
