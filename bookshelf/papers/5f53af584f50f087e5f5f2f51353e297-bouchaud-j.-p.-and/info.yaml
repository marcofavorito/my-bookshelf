abstract: 'We provide further evidence that markets trend on the medium term (months)
  and mean-revert on the long term (several years). Our results bolster Black''s intuition
  that prices tend to be off roughly by a factor of 2, and take years to equilibrate.
  The story behind these results fits well with the existence of two types of behaviour
  in financial markets: "chartists", who act as trend followers, and "fundamentalists",
  who set in when the price is clearly out of line. Mean-reversion is a self-correcting
  mechanism, tempering (albeit only weakly) the exuberance of financial markets.'
