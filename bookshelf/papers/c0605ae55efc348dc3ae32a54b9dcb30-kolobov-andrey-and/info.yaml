abstract: Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) MDPs is a problem class widely studied in
  AI, especially in probabilistic planning. They describe a wide range of scenarios
  but make the restrictive assumption that the goal is reachable from any state, i.e.,
  that dead-end states do not exist. Because of this, SSPs are unable to model various
  scenarios that may have catastrophic events (e.g., an airplane possibly crashing
  if it flies into a storm). Even though MDP algorithms have been used for solving
  problems with dead ends, a principled theory of SSP extensions that would allow
  dead ends, including theoretically sound algorithms for solving such MDPs, has been
  lacking. In this paper, we propose three new MDP classes that admit dead ends under
  increasingly weaker assumptions. We present Value Iteration-based as well as the
  more efficient heuristic search algorithms for optimally solving each class, and
  explore theoretical relationships between these classes. We also conduct a preliminary
  empirical study comparing the performance of our algorithms on different MDP classes,
  especially on scenarios with unavoidable dead ends.
