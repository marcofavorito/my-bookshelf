abstract: The success of blockchain as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies
  has opened up possibilities for its use in other application domains as well. The
  main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other domains are its inherent
  security mechanisms and immunity to different attacks. A blockchain relies on a
  consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which
  are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high
  computational power and thus are not apt for resource-constrained systems.   In
  this article, we discuss and survey the various blockchain based consensus methods
  that are applicable to resource constrained IoT devices and networks. A typical
  IoT network consists of several devices which have limited computational and communications
  capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and
  are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can
  be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying
  consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain
  like private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT
  networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented
  and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain based IoT
  network. Some of the open research challenges are also put forward.
