abstract: The paper presents Tendermint, a new protocol for ordering events in a distributed
  network under adversarial conditions. More commonly known as Byzantine Fault Tolerant
  (BFT) consensus or atomic broadcast, the problem has attracted significant attention
  in recent years due to the widespread success of blockchain-based digital currencies,
  such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which successfully solved the problem in a public
  setting without a central authority. Tendermint modernizes classic academic work
  on the subject and simplifies the design of the BFT algorithm by relying on a peer-to-peer
  gossip protocol among nodes.
