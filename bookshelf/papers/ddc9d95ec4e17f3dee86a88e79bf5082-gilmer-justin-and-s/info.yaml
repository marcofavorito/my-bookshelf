abstract: Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in
  chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and
  closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already
  been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm
  and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At
  this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general
  approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them
  or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models
  into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and
  explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate
  state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark;
  these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets
  with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.
