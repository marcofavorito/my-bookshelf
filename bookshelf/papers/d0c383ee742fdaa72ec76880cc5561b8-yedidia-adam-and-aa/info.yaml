abstract: Since the definition of the Busy Beaver function by Rado in 1962, an interesting
  open question has been the smallest value of n for which BB(n) is independent of
  ZFC set theory. Is this n approximately 10, or closer to 1,000,000, or is it even
  larger? In this paper, we show that it is at most 7,910 by presenting an explicit
  description of a 7,910-state Turing machine Z with 1 tape and a 2-symbol alphabet
  that cannot be proved to run forever in ZFC (even though it presumably does), assuming
  ZFC is consistent. The machine is based on the work of Harvey Friedman on independent
  statements involving order-invariant graphs. In doing so, we give the first known
  upper bound on the highest provable Busy Beaver number in ZFC. To create Z, we develop
  and use a higher-level language, Laconic, which is much more convenient than direct
  state manipulation. We also use Laconic to design two Turing machines, G and R,
  that halt if and only if there are counterexamples to Goldbach's Conjecture and
  the Riemann Hypothesis, respectively.
