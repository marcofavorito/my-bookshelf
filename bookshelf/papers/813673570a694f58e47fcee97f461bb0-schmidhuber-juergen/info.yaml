abstract: Most traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems of the past 50 years
  are either very limited, or based on heuristics, or both. The new millennium, however,
  has brought substantial progress in the field of theoretically optimal and practically
  feasible algorithms for prediction, search, inductive inference based on Occam's
  razor, problem solving, decision making, and reinforcement learning in environments
  of a very general type. Since inductive inference is at the heart of all inductive
  sciences, some of the results are relevant not only for AI and computer science
  but also for physics, provoking nontraditional predictions based on Zuse's thesis
  of the computer-generated universe.
