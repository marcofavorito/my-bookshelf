abstract: Anonymous peer review is used by the great majority of computer science
  conferences. OpenReview is such a platform that aims to promote openness in peer
  review process. The paper, (meta) reviews, rebuttals, and final decisions are all
  released to public. We collect 5,527 submissions and their 16,853 reviews from the
  OpenReview platform. We also collect these submissions' citation data from Google
  Scholar and their non-peer-reviewed versions from arXiv.org. By acquiring deep insights
  into these data, we have several interesting findings that could help understand
  the effectiveness of the public-accessible double-blind peer review process. Our
  results can potentially help writing a paper, reviewing it, and deciding on its
  acceptance.
