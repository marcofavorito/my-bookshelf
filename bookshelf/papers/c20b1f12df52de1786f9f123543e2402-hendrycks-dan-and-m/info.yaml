abstract: 'Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked growing
  concerns among experts, policymakers, and world leaders regarding the potential
  for increasingly advanced AI systems to pose catastrophic risks. Although numerous
  risks have been detailed separately, there is a pressing need for a systematic discussion
  and illustration of the potential dangers to better inform efforts to mitigate them.
  This paper provides an overview of the main sources of catastrophic AI risks, which
  we organize into four categories: malicious use, in which individuals or groups
  intentionally use AIs to cause harm; AI race, in which competitive environments
  compel actors to deploy unsafe AIs or cede control to AIs; organizational risks,
  highlighting how human factors and complex systems can increase the chances of catastrophic
  accidents; and rogue AIs, describing the inherent difficulty in controlling agents
  far more intelligent than humans. For each category of risk, we describe specific
  hazards, present illustrative stories, envision ideal scenarios, and propose practical
  suggestions for mitigating these dangers. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive
  understanding of these risks and inspire collective and proactive efforts to ensure
  that AIs are developed and deployed in a safe manner. Ultimately, we hope this will
  allow us to realize the benefits of this powerful technology while minimizing the
  potential for catastrophic outcomes.'
