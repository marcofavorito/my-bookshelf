abstract: A deeper comprehension of financial markets necessitates understanding not
  only the statistical dependencies among various entities but also the causal dependencies.
  This paper extends the Constraint-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data
  algorithm to account for lagged relationships in time-series data (an algorithm
  we call CD-NOTS), shedding light on the complex causal relations between different
  financial assets and variables. We compare the performance of different algorithmic
  choices, such as the choice of conditional independence test, to give general advice
  on the effective way to use CD-NOTS. Using the results from the simulated data,
  we apply CD-NOTS to a broad range of indices and factors in order to identify causal
  connections among the entities, thereby showing how causal discovery can serve as
  a valuable tool for factor-based investing, portfolio diversification, and comprehension
  of market dynamics. Further, we show our algorithm is a more effective alternative
  to other causal discovery algorithms since the assumptions of our algorithm are
  more realistic in terms of financial data, a conclusion we find is statistically
  significant.
