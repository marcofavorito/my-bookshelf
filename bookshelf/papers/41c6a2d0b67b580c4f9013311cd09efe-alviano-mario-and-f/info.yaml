abstract: In this paper, a new technique for the optimization of (partially) bound
  queries over disjunctive Datalog programs with stratified negation is presented.
  The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings and extends the Magic Set
  (MS) optimization technique.   An important feature of disjunctive Datalog is nonmonotonicity,
  which calls for nondeterministic implementations, such as backtracking search. A
  distinguishing characteristic of the new method is that the optimization can be
  exploited also during the nondeterministic phase. In particular, after some assumptions
  have been made during the computation, parts of the program may become irrelevant
  to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic pruning of the search
  space. In contrast, the effect of the previously defined MS methods for disjunctive
  Datalog is limited to the deterministic portion of the process. In this way, the
  potential performance gain by using the proposed method can be exponential, as could
  be observed empirically.   The correctness of MS is established thanks to a strong
  relationship between MS and unfounded sets that has not been studied in the literature
  before. This knowledge allows for extending the method also to programs with stratified
  negation in a natural way.   The proposed method has been implemented in DLV and
  various experiments have been conducted. Experimental results on synthetic data
  confirm the utility of MS for disjunctive Datalog, and they highlight the computational
  gain that may be obtained by the new method w.r.t. the previously proposed MS methods
  for disjunctive Datalog programs. Further experiments on real-world data show the
  benefits of MS within an application scenario that has received considerable attention
  in recent years, the problem of answering user queries over possibly inconsistent
  databases originating from integration of autonomous sources of information.
