abstract: The ability to use symbols is the pinnacle of human intelligence, but has
  yet to be fully replicated in machines. Here we argue that the path towards symbolically
  fluent artificial intelligence (AI) begins with a reinterpretation of what symbols
  are, how they come to exist, and how a system behaves when it uses them. We begin
  by offering an interpretation of symbols as entities whose meaning is established
  by convention. But crucially, something is a symbol only for those who demonstrably
  and actively participate in this convention. We then outline how this interpretation
  thematically unifies the behavioural traits humans exhibit when they use symbols.
  This motivates our proposal that the field place a greater emphasis on symbolic
  behaviour rather than particular computational mechanisms inspired by more restrictive
  interpretations of symbols. Finally, we suggest that AI research explore social
  and cultural engagement as a tool to develop the cognitive machinery necessary for
  symbolic behaviour to emerge. This approach will allow for AI to interpret something
  as symbolic on its own rather than simply manipulate things that are only symbols
  to human onlookers, and thus will ultimately lead to AI with more human-like symbolic
  fluency.
