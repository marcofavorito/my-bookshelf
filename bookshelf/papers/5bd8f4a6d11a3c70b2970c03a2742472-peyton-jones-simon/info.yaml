abstract: 'My 1987 book is now out of print, but it is available here in its entirety
  in PDF form, in one of two formats:


  single-page portrait

  double-page landscape


  Both are fully searchable, thanks to OCR and Norman Ramsey.


  Errata


  Section 5.2.4, p87.Â  We need an extra rule


  match us [] E = E

  This accounts for the possibility that in the constructor rule (Section 5.2.4) there
  may be some non-nullary constructors for which there are no equations.



  P168, line 2, VAR should be TVAR.'
