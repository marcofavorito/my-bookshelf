abstract: Most classical planners use grounding as a preprocessing step, essentially
  reducing planning to propositional logic. However, grounding involves instantiating
  all action rules with concrete object combinations, and results in large encodings
  for SAT/QBF-based planners. This severe cost in memory becomes a main bottleneck
  when actions have many parameters, such as in the Organic Synthesis problems from
  the IPC 2018 competition. We provide a compact QBF encoding that is logarithmic
  in the number of objects and avoids grounding completely, by using universal quantification
  for object combinations. We show that we can solve some of the Organic Synthesis
  problems, which could not be handled before by any SAT/QBF based planners due to
  grounding.
