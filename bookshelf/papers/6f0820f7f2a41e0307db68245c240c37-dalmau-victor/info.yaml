abstract: In this paper we systematically investigate the connections between logics
  with a finite number of variables, structures of bounded pathwidth, and linear Datalog
  Programs. We prove that, in the context of Constraint Satisfaction Problems, all
  these concepts correspond to different mathematical embodiments of a unique robust
  notion that we call bounded path duality. We also study the computational complexity
  implications of the notion of bounded path duality. We show that every constraint
  satisfaction problem $\csp(\best)$ with bounded path duality is solvable in NL and
  that this notion explains in a uniform way all families of CSPs known to be in NL.
  Finally, we use the results developed in the paper to identify new problems in NL.
