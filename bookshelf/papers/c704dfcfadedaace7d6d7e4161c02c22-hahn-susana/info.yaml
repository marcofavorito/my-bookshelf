abstract: Temporal and dynamic extensions of Answer Set Programming (ASP) have played
  an important role in addressing dynamic problems, as they allow the use of temporal
  operators to reason with dynamic scenarios in a very effective way. In my Ph.D.
  research, I intend to exploit the relationship between automata theory and dynamic
  logic to add automata-based techniques to the ASP solver CLINGO helping us to deal
  with theses type of problems.
