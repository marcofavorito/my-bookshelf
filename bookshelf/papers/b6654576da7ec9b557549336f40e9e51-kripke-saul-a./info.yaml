abstract: In his paper on the incompleteness theorems, G\"odel seemed to say that
  a direct way of constructing a formula that says of itself that it is unprovable
  might involve a faulty circularity. In this note, it is proved that 'direct' self-reference
  can actually be used to prove his result.
