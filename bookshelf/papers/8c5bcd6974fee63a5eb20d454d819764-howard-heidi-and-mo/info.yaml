abstract: Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the face of failures
  and asynchrony, is a fundamental primitive for constructing reliable distributed
  systems from unreliable components. The Paxos algorithm is synonymous with distributed
  consensus, yet it performs poorly in practice and is famously difficult to understand.
  In this paper, we re-examine the foundations of distributed consensus. We derive
  an abstract solution to consensus, which utilises immutable state for intuitive
  reasoning about safety. We prove that our abstract solution generalises over Paxos
  as well as the Fast Paxos and Flexible Paxos algorithms. The surprising result of
  this analysis is a substantial weakening to the quorum requirements of these widely
  studied algorithms.
