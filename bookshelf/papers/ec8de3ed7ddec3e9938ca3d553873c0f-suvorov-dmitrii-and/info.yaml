abstract: 'Modern blockchain systems support creation of smart contracts -- stateful
  programs hosted and executed on a blockchain. Smart contracts hold and transfer
  significant amounts of digital currency which makes them an attractive target for
  security attacks. It has been shown that many contracts deployed to public ledgers
  contain security vulnerabilities. Moreover, the design of blockchain systems does
  not allow the code of the smart contract to be changed after it has been deployed
  to the system. Therefore, it is important to guarantee the correctness of smart
  contracts prior to their deployment.   Formal verification is widely used to check
  smart contracts for correctness with respect to given specification. In this work
  we consider program synthesis techniques in which the specification is used to generate
  correct-by-construction programs. We focus on one of the special cases of program
  synthesis where programs are modeled with finite state machines (FSMs). We show
  how FSM synthesis can be applied to the problem of automatic smart contract generation.
  Several case studies of smart contracts are outlined: crowdfunding platform, blinded
  auction and a license contract. For each case study we specify the corresponding
  smart contract with a set of formulas in linear temporal logic (LTL) and use this
  specification together with test scenarios to synthesize a FSM model for that contract.
  These models are later used to generate executable Solidity code which can be directly
  used in a blockchain system.'
