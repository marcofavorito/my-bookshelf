abstract: 'In recent years, many scholars praised the seemingly endless possibilities
  of using machine learning (ML) techniques in and for agent-based simulation models
  (ABM). To get a more comprehensive understanding of these possibilities, we conduct
  a systematic literature review (SLR) and classify the literature on the application
  of ML in and for ABM according to a theoretically derived classification scheme.
  We do so to investigate how exactly machine learning has been utilized in and for
  agent-based models so far and to critically discuss the combination of these two
  promising methods. We find that, indeed, there is a broad range of possible applications
  of ML to support and complement ABMs in many different ways, already applied in
  many different disciplines. We see that, so far, ML is mainly used in ABM for two
  broad cases: First, the modelling of adaptive agents equipped with experience learning
  and, second, the analysis of outcomes produced by a given ABM. While these are the
  most frequent, there also exist a variety of many more interesting applications.
  This being the case, researchers should dive deeper into the analysis of when and
  how which kinds of ML techniques can support ABM, e.g. by conducting a more in-depth
  analysis and comparison of different use cases. Nonetheless, as the application
  of ML in and for ABM comes at certain costs, researchers should not use ML for ABMs
  just for the sake of doing it.'
