abstract: 'Worst-case optimal join algorithms are the class of join algorithms whose
  runtime match the worst-case output size of a given join query. While the first
  provably worst-case optimal join algorithm was discovered relatively recently, the
  techniques and results surrounding these algorithms grow out of decades of research
  from a wide range of areas, intimately connecting graph theory, algorithms, information
  theory, constraint satisfaction, database theory, and geometric inequalities. These
  ideas are not just paperware: in addition to academic project implementations, two
  variations of such algorithms are the work-horse join algorithms of commercial database
  and data analytics engines.   This paper aims to be a brief introduction to the
  design and analysis of worst-case optimal join algorithms. We discuss the key techniques
  for proving runtime and output size bounds. We particularly focus on the fascinating
  connection between join algorithms and information theoretic inequalities, and the
  idea of how one can turn a proof into an algorithm. Finally, we conclude with a
  representative list of fundamental open problems in this area.'
