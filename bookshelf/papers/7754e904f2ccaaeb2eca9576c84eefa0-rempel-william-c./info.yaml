abstract: NATIONAL BESTSELLER\&;Offers an entertaining look at Kerkorian\&;s outsize
  life\&; an interesting portrait of a billionaire.\&; \&; Wall Street JournalThe
  rags-to-riches story of one of America\&;s wealthiest and least-known financial
  giants, self-made billionaire Kirk Kerkorian\&;the daring aviator, movie mogul,
  risk-taker, and business tycoon who transformed Las Vegas and Hollywood to become
  one of the leading financiers in American business.Kerkorian combined the courage
  of a World War II pilot, the fortitude of a scrappy boxer, the cunning of an inscrutable
  poker player and an unmatched genius for making deals. He never put his name on
  a building, but when he died he owned almost every major hotel and casino in Las
  Vegas. He envisioned and fostered a new industry \&;the leisure business. Three
  times he built the biggest resort hotel in the world. Three times he bought and
  sold the fabled MGM Studios, forever changing the way Hollywood does business.His
  early life began as far as possible from a place on the Forbes List of Billionaires
  when he and his Armenian immigrant family lost their farm to foreclosure. He was
  four. They arrived in Los Angeles penniless and moved often, staying one step ahead
  of more evictions. Young Kirk learned English on the streets of L.A., made pennies
  hawking newspapers and dropped out after eighth grade. How he went on to become
  one of the richest and most generous men in America\&;his net worth as much as $20
  billion\&;is a story largely unknown to the world. That\&;s because what Kerkorian
  valued most was his privacy. His very private life turned to tabloid fodder late
  in life when a former professional tennis player falsely claimed that the eighty-five-year-old
  billionaire fathered her child.In this engrossing biography, investigative reporter
  William C. Rempel digs deep into Kerkorian\&;s long-guarded history to introduce
  a man of contradictions\&;a poorly educated genius for deal-making, an extraordinarily
  shy man who made the boldest of business ventures, a careful and calculating investor
  who was willing to bet everything on a single roll of the dice.Unlike others of
  his status and importance, Kerkorian made few public appearances and strenuously
  avoided personal publicity. His friends and associates, however, were some of the
  biggest names in business, entertainment, and sports\&;among them Howard Hughes,
  Ted Turner, Steve Wynn, Michael Milken, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand,
  Elvis Presley, Mike Tyson, and Andre Agassi.When he died in 2015 two years shy of
  the century mark, Kerkorian had outlived many of his closest friends and associates.
  Now, Rempel meticulously pieces together revealing fragments of Kerkorian\&;s life,
  collected from diverse sources\&;war records, business archives, court documents,
  news clippings and the recollections and recorded memories of longtime pals and
  relatives. In The Gambler, Rempel illuminates this unknown, self-made man and his
  inspiring legacy as never before.
