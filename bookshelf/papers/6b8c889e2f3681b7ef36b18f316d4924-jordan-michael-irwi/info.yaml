abstract: From the Publisher:Graphical models use graphs to represent and manipulate
  joint probability distributions. They have their roots in artificial intelligence,
  statistics, and neural networks. The clean mathematical formalism of the graphical
  models framework makes it possible to understand a wide variety of network-based
  approaches to computation, and in particular to understand many neural network algorithms
  and architectures as instances of a broader probabilistic methodology. It also makes
  it possible to identify novel features of neural network algorithms and architectures
  and to extend them to more general graphical models.  This book exemplifies the
  interplay between the general formal framework of graphical models and the exploration
  of new algorithms and architectures. The articles, which are drawn from the journal
  Neural Computation, range from foundational papers of historical importance to results
  at the cutting edge of research.
