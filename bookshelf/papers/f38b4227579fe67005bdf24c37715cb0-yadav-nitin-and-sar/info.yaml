abstract: The behavior composition problem involves automatically building a controller
  that is able to realize a desired, but unavailable, target system (e.g., a house
  surveillance) by suitably coordinating a set of available components (e.g., video
  cameras, blinds, lamps, a vacuum cleaner, phones, etc.) Previous work has almost
  exclusively aimed at bringing about the desired component in its totality, which
  is highly unsatisfactory for unsolvable problems. In this work, we develop an approach
  for approximate behavior composition without departing from the classical setting,
  thus making the problem applicable to a much wider range of cases. Based on the
  notion of simulation, we characterize what a maximal controller and the "closest"
  implementable target module (optimal approximation) are, and show how these can
  be computed using ATL model checking technology for a special case. We show the
  uniqueness of optimal approximations, and prove their soundness and completeness
  with respect to their imported controllers.
