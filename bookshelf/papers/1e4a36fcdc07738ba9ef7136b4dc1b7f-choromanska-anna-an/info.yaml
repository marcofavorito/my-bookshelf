abstract: 'We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of
  a simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the Hamiltonian
  of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i) variable independence,
  ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii) uniformity. These assumptions
  enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through
  the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size
  decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a
  layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the
  global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially
  with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model
  exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high
  dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD
  converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found
  there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes
  a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor
  quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove
  that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases
  and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.'
