abstract: Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) enables large-scale language models to
  solve complex reasoning problems by decomposing the problem and tackling it step-by-step.
  However, Chain-of-Thought is a greedy thinking process that requires the language
  model to come up with a starting point and generate the next step solely based on
  previous steps. This thinking process is different from how humans approach a complex
  problem e.g., we proactively raise sub-problems related to the original problem
  and recursively answer them. In this work, we propose Socratic Questioning, a divide-and-conquer
  fashion algorithm that simulates the self-questioning and recursive thinking process.
  Socratic Questioning is driven by a Self-Questioning module that employs a large-scale
  language model to propose sub-problems related to the original problem as intermediate
  steps and Socratic Questioning recursively backtracks and answers the sub-problems
  until reaches the original problem. We apply our proposed algorithm to the visual
  question-answering task as a case study and by evaluating it on three public benchmark
  datasets, we observe a significant performance improvement over all baselines on
  (almost) all datasets. In addition, the qualitative analysis clearly demonstrates
  the intermediate thinking steps elicited by Socratic Questioning are similar to
  the human's recursively thinking process of a complex reasoning problem.
