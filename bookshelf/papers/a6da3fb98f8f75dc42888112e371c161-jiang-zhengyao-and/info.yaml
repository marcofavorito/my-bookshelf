abstract: Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution
  of a fund into different financial products. This paper presents a financial-model-free
  Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution to
  the portfolio management problem. The framework consists of the Ensemble of Identical
  Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online
  Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward
  function. This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term
  Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection
  strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30
  minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized
  alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example
  of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three
  positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although
  with a high commission rate of 0.25% in the backtests, the framework is able to
  achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.
