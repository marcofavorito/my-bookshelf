abstract: In this paper, we consider the task of learning control policies for text-based
  games. In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and
  the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such
  environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement
  learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using
  game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into
  vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate
  our approach on two game worlds, comparing against baselines using bag-of-words
  and bag-of-bigrams for state representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines
  on both worlds demonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations.
