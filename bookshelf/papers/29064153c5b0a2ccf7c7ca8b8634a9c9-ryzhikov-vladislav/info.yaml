abstract: We investigate the data complexity of answering queries mediated by metric
  temporal logic ontologies under the event-based semantics assuming that data instances
  are finite timed words timestamped with binary fractions. We identify classes of
  ontology-mediated queries answering which can be done in AC0, NC1, L, NL, P, and
  coNP for data complexity, provide their rewritings to first-order logic and its
  extensions with primitive recursion, transitive closure or datalog, and establish
  lower complexity bounds.
