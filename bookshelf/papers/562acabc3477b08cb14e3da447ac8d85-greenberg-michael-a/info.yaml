abstract: 'Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) offer sound, complete, and decidable
  equational reasoning about regularly structured programs. Interest in KATs has increased
  greatly since NetKAT demonstrated how well extensions of KATs with domain-specific
  primitives and extra axioms apply to computer networks. Unfortunately, extending
  a KAT to a new domain by adding custom primitives, proving its equational theory
  sound and complete, and coming up with an efficient implementation is still an expert''s
  task. Abstruse metatheory is holding back KAT''s potential.   We offer a fast path
  to a "minimum viable model" of a KAT, formally or in code through our framework,
  Kleene algebra modulo theories (KMT). Given primitives and a notion of state, we
  can automatically derive a corresponding KAT''s semantics, prove its equational
  theory sound and complete with respect to a tracing semantics (programs are denoted
  as traces of states), and derive a normalization-based decision procedure for equivalence
  checking. Our framework is based on pushback, a generalization of weakest preconditions
  that specifies how predicates and actions interact. We offer several case studies,
  showing tracing variants of theories from the literature (bitvectors, NetKAT) along
  with novel compositional theories (products, temporal logic, and sets). We derive
  new results over unbounded state, reasoning about monotonically increasing, unbounded
  natural numbers. Our OCaml implementation closely matches the theory: users define
  and compose KATs with the module system.'
