abstract: 'This paper presents a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for
  neural networks that scales with their margin-normalized "spectral complexity":
  their Lipschitz constant, meaning the product of the spectral norms of the weight
  matrices, times a certain correction factor. This bound is empirically investigated
  for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the mnist and cifar10 datasets,
  with both original and random labels; the bound, the Lipschitz constants, and the
  excess risks are all in direct correlation, suggesting both that SGD selects predictors
  whose complexity scales with the difficulty of the learning task, and secondly that
  the presented bound is sensitive to this complexity.'
