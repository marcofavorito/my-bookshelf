abstract: Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements,
  news articles, etc) to individual users by making use of both content and user information.
  Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two
  reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content,
  rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the
  scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both
  fast in learning and computation.   In this work, we model personalized recommendation
  of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which
  a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual
  information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection
  strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks.   The contributions
  of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit
  algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory.
  Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using
  previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method,
  we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset
  containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to
  a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater
  when data gets more scarce.
