abstract: 'Ontology-based query answering (OBQA) asks whether a Boolean conjunctive
  query is satisfied by all models of a logical theory consisting of a relational
  database paired with an ontology. The introduction of existential rules (i.e., Datalog
  rules extended with existential quantifiers in rule-heads) as a means to specify
  the ontology gave birth to Datalog+/-, a framework that has received increasing
  attention in the last decade, with focus also on decidability and finite controllability
  to support effective reasoning. Five basic decidable fragments have been singled
  out: linear, weakly-acyclic, guarded, sticky, and shy. Moreover, for all these fragments,
  except shy, the important property of finite controllability has been proved, ensuring
  that a query is satisfied by all models of the theory iff it is satisfied by all
  its finite models. In this paper we complete the picture by demonstrating that finite
  controllability of OBQA holds also for shy ontologies, and it therefore applies
  to all basic decidable Datalog+/- classes. To make the demonstration, we devise
  a general technique to facilitate the process of (dis)proving finite controllability
  of an arbitrary ontological fragment. This paper is under consideration for acceptance
  in TPLP.'
