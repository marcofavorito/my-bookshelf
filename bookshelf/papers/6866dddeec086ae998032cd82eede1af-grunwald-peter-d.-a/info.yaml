abstract: We introduce algorithmic information theory, also known as the theory of
  Kolmogorov complexity. We explain the main concepts of this quantitative approach
  to defining `information'. We discuss the extent to which Kolmogorov's and Shannon's
  information theory have a common purpose, and where they are fundamentally different.
  We indicate how recent developments within the theory allow one to formally distinguish
  between `structural' (meaningful) and `random' information as measured by the Kolmogorov
  structure function, which leads to a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor
  in inductive inference. We end by discussing some of the philosophical implications
  of the theory.
