abstract: 'Stablecoins provide an alternative to volatile crypto-assets. Depending
  on their asset management function, they may fall under different regulatory regimes
  or – with certain design features – under none at all. Given their potential size,
  global stablecoins could pose risks to financial stability. Such arrangements need
  a robust regulatory framework. JEL Classification: E42, G15, G28'
