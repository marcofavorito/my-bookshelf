abstract: This paper considers the optimal adaptive allocation of measurement effort
  for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs. An experimenter
  sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality
  with the goal of confidently identifying the best design after a small number of
  measurements. This paper proposes three simple and intuitive Bayesian algorithms
  for adaptively allocating measurement effort, and formalizes a sense in which these
  seemingly naive rules are the best possible. One proposal is top-two probability
  sampling, which computes the two designs with the highest posterior probability
  of being optimal, and then randomizes to select among these two. One is a variant
  of top-two sampling which considers not only the probability a design is optimal,
  but the expected amount by which its quality exceeds that of other designs. The
  final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for
  identifying the best design. We prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a sharp
  optimality property. In a frequentist setting where the true quality of the designs
  is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in
  the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other
  design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. We show that
  under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an exponential rate, and
  the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation
