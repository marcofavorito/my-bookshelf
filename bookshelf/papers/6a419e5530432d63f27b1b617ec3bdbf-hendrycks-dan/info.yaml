abstract: For billions of years, evolution has been the driving force behind the development
  of life, including humans. Evolution endowed humans with high intelligence, which
  allowed us to become one of the most successful species on the planet. Today, humans
  aim to create artificial intelligence systems that surpass even our own intelligence.
  As artificial intelligences (AIs) evolve and eventually surpass us in all domains,
  how might evolution shape our relations with AIs? By analyzing the environment that
  is shaping the evolution of AIs, we argue that the most successful AI agents will
  likely have undesirable traits. Competitive pressures among corporations and militaries
  will give rise to AI agents that automate human roles, deceive others, and gain
  power. If such agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, this could
  lead to humanity losing control of its future. More abstractly, we argue that natural
  selection operates on systems that compete and vary, and that selfish species typically
  have an advantage over species that are altruistic to other species. This Darwinian
  logic could also apply to artificial agents, as agents may eventually be better
  able to persist into the future if they behave selfishly and pursue their own interests
  with little regard for humans, which could pose catastrophic risks. To counteract
  these risks and evolutionary forces, we consider interventions such as carefully
  designing AI agents' intrinsic motivations, introducing constraints on their actions,
  and institutions that encourage cooperation. These steps, or others that resolve
  the problems we pose, will be necessary in order to ensure the development of artificial
  intelligence is a positive one.
