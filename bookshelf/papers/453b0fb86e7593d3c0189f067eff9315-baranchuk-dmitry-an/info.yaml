abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have recently received much research
  attention since they outperform alternative approaches, such as GANs, and currently
  provide state-of-the-art generative performance. The superior performance of diffusion
  models has made them an appealing tool in several applications, including inpainting,
  super-resolution, and semantic editing. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion
  models can also serve as an instrument for semantic segmentation, especially in
  the setup when labeled data is scarce. In particular, for several pretrained diffusion
  models, we investigate the intermediate activations from the networks that perform
  the Markov step of the reverse diffusion process. We show that these activations
  effectively capture the semantic information from an input image and appear to be
  excellent pixel-level representations for the segmentation problem. Based on these
  observations, we describe a simple segmentation method, which can work even if only
  a few training images are provided. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing
  alternatives on several datasets for the same amount of human supervision.
