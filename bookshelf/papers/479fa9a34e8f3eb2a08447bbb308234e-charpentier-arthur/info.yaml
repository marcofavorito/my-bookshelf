abstract: 'Reinforcement learning algorithms describe how an agent can learn an optimal
  action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. In
  a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal rewards.
  As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in multi-armed bandit problems,
  when an agent picks an action, he can not infer ex-post the rewards induced by other
  action choices. In reinforcement learning, his actions have consequences: they influence
  not only rewards, but also future states of the world. The goal of reinforcement
  learning is to find an optimal policy -- a mapping from the states of the world
  to the set of actions, in order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term
  strategy. Exploring might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead
  to optimal long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics
  for more than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework,
  and recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep learning
  algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex behavioral problems.
  In this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning techniques,
  and present applications in economics, game theory, operation research and finance.'
