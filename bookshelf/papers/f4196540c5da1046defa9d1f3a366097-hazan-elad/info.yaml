abstract: This manuscript portrays optimization as a process. In many practical applications
  the environment is so complex that it is infeasible to lay out a comprehensive theoretical
  model and use classical algorithmic theory and mathematical optimization. It is
  necessary as well as beneficial to take a robust approach, by applying an optimization
  method that learns as one goes along, learning from experience as more aspects of
  the problem are observed. This view of optimization as a process has become prominent
  in varied fields and has led to some spectacular success in modeling and systems
  that are now part of our daily lives.
