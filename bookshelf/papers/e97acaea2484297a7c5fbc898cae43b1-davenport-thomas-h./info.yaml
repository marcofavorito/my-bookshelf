abstract: Ten years ago, the authors posited that being a data scientist was the “sexiest
  job of the 21st century.” A decade later, does the claim stand up? The job has grown
  in popularity and is generally well-paid, and the field is projected to experience
  more growth than almost any other by 2029. But the job has changed, in both large
  and small ways. It’s become better institutionalized, the scope of the job has been
  redefined, the technology it relies on has made huge strides, and the importance
  of non-technical expertise, such as ethics and change management, has grown. How
  it operates in companies — and how executives need to think about managing data
  science efforts — has changed, too, as businesses now need to create and oversee
  diverse data science teams rather than searching for data scientist unicorns. Finally,
  companies need to think about what comes next, and how they can begin to think about
  democratizing data science.
