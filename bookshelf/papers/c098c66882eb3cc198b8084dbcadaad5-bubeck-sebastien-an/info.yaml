abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining
  large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety
  of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The
  latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale
  of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version
  of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this
  early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and
  Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous
  AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models.
  We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult
  tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more,
  without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's
  performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses
  prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities,
  we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete)
  version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of
  GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the
  challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of
  AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word
  prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological
  leap and future research directions.
