abstract: Evolutionary symbolic regression (SR) fits a symbolic equation to data,
  which gives a concise interpretable model. We explore using SR as a method to propose
  which data to gather in an active learning setting with physical constraints. SR
  with active learning proposes which experiments to do next. Active learning is done
  with query by committee, where the Pareto frontier of equations is the committee.
  The physical constraints improve proposed equations in very low data settings. These
  approaches reduce the data required for SR and achieves state of the art results
  in data required to rediscover known equations.
