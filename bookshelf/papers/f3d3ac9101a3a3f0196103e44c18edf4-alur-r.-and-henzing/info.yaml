abstract: The theory of the natural numbers with linear order and monadic predicates
  underlies propositional linear temporal logic. To study temporal logics that are
  suitable for reasoning about real-time systems, we combine this classical theory
  of infinite state sequences with a theory of discrete time, via a monotonic function
  that maps every state to its time. The resulting theory of timed state sequences
  is shown to be decidable, albeit nonelementary, and its expressive power is characterized
  by Ï‰-regular sets. Several more expressive variants are proved to be highly undecidable.
  This framework allows us to classify a wide variety of real-time logics according
  to their complexity and expressiveness. Indeed, it follows that most formalisms
  proposed in the literature cannot be decided. We are, however, able to identify
  two elementary real-time temporal logics as expressively complete fragments of the
  theory of timed state sequences, and we present tableau-based decision procedures
  for checking validity. Consequently, these two formalisms are well-suited for the
  specification and verification of real-time systems.
