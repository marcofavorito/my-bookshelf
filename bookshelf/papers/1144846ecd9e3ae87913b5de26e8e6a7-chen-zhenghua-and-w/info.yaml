abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing research and development
  (R&D) discipline which is attracting increasing attention because of its promises
  to bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses, with considerable benefits
  promised in productivity growth and innovation. To date it has reported significant
  accomplishments in many areas that have been deemed as challenging for machines,
  ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio analysis to smart
  sensing and many others. The technical trend in realizing the successes has been
  towards increasing complex and large size AI models so as to solve more complex
  problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid progress, however, has
  taken place at the expense of substantial environmental costs and resources. Besides,
  debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as fairness, safety and privacy, have
  continued to grow in intensity. These issues have presented major concerns pertaining
  to the sustainable development of AI. In this work, we review major trends in machine
  learning approaches that can address the sustainability problem of AI. Specifically,
  we examine emerging AI methodologies and algorithms for addressing the sustainability
  issue of AI in two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social
  sustainability of AI. We will also highlight the major limitations of existing studies
  and propose potential research challenges and directions for the development of
  next generation of sustainable AI techniques. We believe that this technical review
  can help to promote a sustainable development of AI R&D activities for the research
  community.
