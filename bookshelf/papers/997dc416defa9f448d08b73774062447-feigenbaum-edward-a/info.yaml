abstract: 'From the Publisher:  Computers and Thought  showcases the work of the scientists
  who not only defined the field of Artificial Intelligence, but who are responsible
  for having developed it into what it is today. Originally published in 1963, this
  collection includes twenty classic papers by such pioneers as A. M. Turing and Marvin
  Minsky who were behind the pivotal advances in artificially simulating human thought
  processes with computers.  Among the now hard-to-find articles are reports of computer
  programs that play chess and checkers, prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve
  problems in calculus, balance assembly lines, recognize visual temporal patterns,
  and communicate in natural language. The reports of simulation of cognitive processes
  include computer models of human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common
  stock portfolios, and carrying out social interaction. Models of verbal learning
  behavior, predictive behavior in two-choice experiments, and concept formation are
  also included.   Articles byâ€¯: Paul Armer. Carol Chomsky. Geoffrey P. E. Clarkson.
