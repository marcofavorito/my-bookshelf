abstract: 'Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large
  number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential remains largely unlocked
  since most work so far requires strict assumptions which do not hold true in practice.
  To address this challenge and make progress in solving real-world problems, we propose
  a new way of thinking about causality - we call this causal deep learning. The framework
  which we propose for causal deep learning spans three dimensions: (1) a structural
  dimension, which allows incomplete causal knowledge rather than assuming either
  full or no causal knowledge; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric
  forms which are typically ignored; and finally, (3) a temporal dimension, which
  explicitly allows for situations which capture exposure times or temporal structure.
  Together, these dimensions allow us to make progress on a variety of real-world
  problems by leveraging (sometimes incomplete) causal knowledge and/or combining
  diverse causal deep learning methods. This new framework also enables researchers
  to compare systematically across existing works as well as identify promising research
  areas which can lead to real-world impact.'
