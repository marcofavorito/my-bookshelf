abstract: In a previous note (arXiv:1712.01367 [cs.DC]) , we observed a safety violation
  in Zyzzyva and a liveness violation in FaB. In this manuscript, we sketch fixes
  to both. The same view-change core is applied in the two schemes, and additionally,
  applied to combine them and create a single, enhanced scheme that has the benefits
  of both approaches.
