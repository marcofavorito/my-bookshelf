abstract: The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market is mushrooming in the recent couple
  of years. The concept of NFT originally comes from a token standard of Ethereum,
  aiming to distinguish each token with distinguishable signs. This type of tokens
  can be bound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identifications. With
  NFTs, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values according
  to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the prosperity
  of the decentralized application (DApp) market. At the time of writing (May 2021),
  the total money used on completed NFT sales has reached $34,530,649.86$ USD. The
  thousandfold return on its increasing market draws huge attention worldwide. However,
  the development of the NFT ecosystem is still in its early stage, and the technologies
  of NFTs are pre-mature. Newcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to
  the lack of systematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the NFT ecosystems
  in several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT solutions,
  then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and desired proprieties.
  Afterward, we give a security evolution, with discussions on the perspectives of
  their design models, opportunities and challenges. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first systematic study on the current NFT ecosystems.
