abstract: These notes present the essentials of first- and second-order monadic logics
  on strings with introductory purposes. We discuss Monadic First-Order logic and
  show that it is strictly less expressive than Finite-State Automata, in that it
  only captures a strict subset of Regular Languages -- the non-counting ones. We
  then introduce Monadic Second-Order logic; such a logic is, syntactically, a superset
  of Monadic First-Order logic and captures Regular Languages exactly. We also show
  how to transform an automaton into a corresponding formula and vice versa. Finally,
  we discuss the use of logical characterizations of classes of languages as the basis
  for automatic verification techniques.
