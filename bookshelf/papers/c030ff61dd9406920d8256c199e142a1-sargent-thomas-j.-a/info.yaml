abstract: This textbook is an introduction to economic networks, intended for students
  and researchers in the fields of economics and applied mathematics. The textbook
  emphasizes quantitative modeling, with the main underlying tools being graph theory,
  linear algebra, fixed point theory and programming. The text is suitable for a one-semester
  course, taught either to advanced undergraduate students who are comfortable with
  linear algebra or to beginning graduate students.
