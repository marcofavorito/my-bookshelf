abstract: We explore the effect of introducing prior information into the intermediate
  level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art machine
  learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from the hypothesis
  that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of
  supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide
  positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered
  MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image
  with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the
  same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are
  placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations.
  The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets
  being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the
  output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event.
  The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able
  to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised
  pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting)
  all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty
  involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em
  composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with
  hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems
  with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.
