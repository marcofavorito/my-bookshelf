abstract: We propose a novel consensus protocol based on a hybrid approach, that combines
  a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a classical chain of blocks. This architecture
  allows us to enforce collective block construction, minimising the monopolistic
  power of the round-leader. In this way, we decrease the possibility for collusion
  among senders and miners, as well as miners themselves, allowing the use of more
  incentive compatible and fair pricing strategies. We investigate these possibilities
  alongside the ability to use the DAG structure to minimise the risk of transaction
  censoring. We conclude by providing preliminary benchmarks of our protocol and by
  exploring further research directions.
