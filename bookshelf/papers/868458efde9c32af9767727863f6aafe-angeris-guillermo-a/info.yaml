abstract: We present a method for constructing Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs)
  whose portfolio value functions match a desired payoff. More specifically, we show
  that the space of concave, nonnegative, nondecreasing, 1-homogeneous payoff functions
  and the space of convex CFMMs are equivalent; in other words, every CFMM has a concave,
  nonnegative, nondecreasing, 1-homogeneous payoff function, and every payoff function
  with these properties has a corresponding convex CFMM. We demonstrate a simple method
  for recovering a CFMM trading function that produces this desired payoff. This method
  uses only basic tools from convex analysis and is intimately related to Fenchel
  conjugacy. We demonstrate our result by constructing trading functions corresponding
  to basic payoffs, as well as standard financial derivatives such as options and
  swaps.
