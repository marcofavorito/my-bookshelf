abstract: 'Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been used to support a wide range of applications,
  from web search to personal assistant. In this paper, we describe three generations
  of knowledge graphs: entity-based KGs, which have been supporting general search
  and question answering (e.g., at Google and Bing); text-rich KGs, which have been
  supporting search and recommendations for products, bio-informatics, etc. (e.g.,
  at Amazon and Alibaba); and the emerging integration of KGs and LLMs, which we call
  dual neural KGs. We describe the characteristics of each generation of KGs, the
  crazy ideas behind the scenes in constructing such KGs, and the techniques developed
  over time to enable industry impact. In addition, we use KGs as examples to demonstrate
  a recipe to evolve research ideas from innovations to production practice, and then
  to the next level of innovations, to advance both science and business.'
