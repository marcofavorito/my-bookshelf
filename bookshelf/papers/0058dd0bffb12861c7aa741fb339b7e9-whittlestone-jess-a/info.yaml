abstract: '<jats:p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an avenue of research in Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) that has received increasing attention within the research community
  in recent years, and is beginning to show potential for real-world application.
  DRL is one of the most promising routes towards developing more autonomous AI systems
  that interact with and take actions in complex real-world environments, and can
  more flexibly solve a range of problems for which we may not be able to precisely
  specify a correct ‘answer’. This could have substantial implications for people’s
  lives: for example by speeding up automation in various sectors, changing the nature
  and potential harms of online influence, or introducing new safety risks in physical
  infrastructure. In this paper, we review recent progress in DRL, discuss how this
  may introduce novel and pressing issues for society, ethics, and governance, and
  highlight important avenues for future research to better understand DRL’s societal
  implications.&#x0D;
