abstract: We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic
  models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium
  thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational
  bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models
  and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit
  a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization
  of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception
  score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain
  sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion
