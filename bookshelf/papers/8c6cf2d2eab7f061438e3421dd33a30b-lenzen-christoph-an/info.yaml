abstract: 'We give fault-tolerant algorithms for establishing synchrony in distributed
  systems in which each of the $n$ nodes has its own clock. Our algorithms operate
  in a very strong fault model: we require self-stabilisation, i.e., the initial state
  of the system may be arbitrary, and there can be up to $f<n/3$ ongoing Byzantine
  faults, i.e., nodes that deviate from the protocol in an arbitrary manner. Furthermore,
  we assume that the local clocks of the nodes may progress at different speeds (clock
  drift) and communication has bounded delay. In this model, we study the pulse synchronisation
  problem, where the task is to guarantee that eventually all correct nodes generate
  well-separated local pulse events (i.e., unlabelled logical clock ticks) in a synchronised
  manner.   Compared to prior work, we achieve exponential improvements in stabilisation
  time and the number of communicated bits, and give the first sublinear-time algorithm
  for the problem:   - In the deterministic setting, the state-of-the-art solutions
  stabilise in time $\Theta(f)$ and have each node broadcast $\Theta(f \log f)$ bits
  per time unit. We exponentially reduce the number of bits broadcasted per time unit
  to $\Theta(\log f)$ while retaining the same stabilisation time.   - In the randomised
  setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in time $\Theta(f)$ and have each
  node broadcast $O(1)$ bits per time unit. We exponentially reduce the stabilisation
  time to $\log^{O(1)} f$ while each node broadcasts $\log^{O(1)} f$ bits per time
  unit.   These results are obtained by means of a recursive approach reducing the
  above task of self-stabilising pulse synchronisation in the bounded-delay model
  to non-self-stabilising binary consensus in the synchronous model. In general, our
  approach introduces at most logarithmic overheads in terms of stabilisation time
  and broadcasted bits over the underlying consensus routine.'
