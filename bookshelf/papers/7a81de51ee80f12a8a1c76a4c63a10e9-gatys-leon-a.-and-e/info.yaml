abstract: In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create
  unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content
  and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown
  and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other
  key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance
  was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called
  Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural
  Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses
  neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary
  images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover,
  in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural
  networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic
  understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.
