abstract: 'We show how Rio''s method [Probab. Theory Related Fields 104 (1996) 255--282]
  can be adapted to establish a rate of convergence in ${\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}$ in the
  multidimensional central limit theorem for some stationary processes in the sense
  of the Kantorovich metric. We give two applications of this general result: in the
  case of the Knudsen gas and in the case of the Sinai billiard.'
