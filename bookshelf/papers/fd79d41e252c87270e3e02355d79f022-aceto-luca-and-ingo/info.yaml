abstract: <jats:p>Formal methods is the term used to describe the specification and
  verification of software and software systems using mathematical logic. Various
  methodologies have been developed and incorporated into software tools. An important
  subclass is distributed systems. There are many books that look at particular methodologies
  for such systems, e.g. CSP, process algebra. This book offers a more balanced introduction
  for graduate students that describes the various approaches, their strengths and
  weaknesses, and when they are best used. Milner's CCS and its operational semantics
  are introduced, together with notions of behavioural equivalence based on bisimulation
  techniques and with variants of Hennessy-Milner modal logics. Later in the book,
  the presented theories are extended to take timing issues into account. The book
  has arisen from various courses taught in Iceland and Denmark and is designed to
  give students a broad introduction to the area, with exercises throughout.</jats:p>
