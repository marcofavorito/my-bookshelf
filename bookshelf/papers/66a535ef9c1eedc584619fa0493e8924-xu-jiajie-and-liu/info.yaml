abstract: <jats:p>In the context of business process management, the resources required
  by business processes, such as workshop staff, manufacturing machines, etc., tend
  to follow certain availability patterns, due to maintenance cycles, work shifts
  and other factors. Such availability patterns heavily influence the efficiency and
  effectiveness of enterprise resource management. Most existing process scheduling
  and resource management approaches tend to tune the process structure to seek better
  resource utilisation, yet neglect the constraints on resource availability. In this
  article, we investigate the scheduling of business process instances in accordance
  with resource availability patterns, to find out how enterprise resources can be
  rationally and sufficiently used. Three heuristic-based planning strategies are
  proposed to maximise the process instance throughput together with another strategy
  based on a genetic algorithm. The performance of these strategies has been evaluated
  by conducting experiments of different settings and analysing the strategy characteristics.</jats:p>
