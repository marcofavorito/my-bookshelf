abstract: We describe a path to humanity safely thriving with powerful Artificial
  General Intelligences (AGIs) by building them to provably satisfy human-specified
  requirements. We argue that this will soon be technically feasible using advanced
  AI for formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. We further argue that
  it is the only path which guarantees safe controlled AGI. We end with a list of
  challenge problems whose solution would contribute to this positive outcome and
  invite readers to join in this work.
