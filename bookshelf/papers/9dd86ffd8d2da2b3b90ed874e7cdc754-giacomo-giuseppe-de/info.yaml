abstract: Runtime monitoring is one of the central tasks in the area of operational
  decision support for business process management. In particular, it helps process
  executors to check on-the-fly whether a running process instance satisfies business
  constraints of interest, providing an immediate feedback when deviations occur.
  We study runtime monitoring of properties expressed in LTL on finite traces (LTLf),
  and in its extension LDLf. LDLf is a powerful logic that captures all monadic second
  order logic on finite traces, and that is obtained by combining regular expressions
  with LTLf, adopting the syntax of propositional dynamic logic (PDL). Interestingly,
  in spite of its greater expressivity, \LDLf has exactly the same computational complexity
  of LTLf.   We show that LDLf is able to declaratively express, in the logic itself,
  not only the constraints to be monitored, but also the de-facto standard RV-LTL
  monitors. On the one hand, this enables us to directly employ the standard characterization
  of LDLf based on finite-state automata to monitor constraints in a fine-grained
  way. On the other hand, it provides the basis for declaratively expressing sophisticated
  metaconstraints that predicate on the monitoring state of other constraints, and
  to check them by relying on standard logical services instead of ad-hoc algorithms.   In
  addition, we devise a direct translation of LDLf formulae into nondeterministic
  finite-state automata, avoiding to detour to Buchi automata or alternating automata.
  We then report on how this approach has been effectively implemented using Java
  to manipulate LDLf formulae and their corresponding monitors, and the well-known
  ProM process mining suite as underlying operational decision support infrastructure.
