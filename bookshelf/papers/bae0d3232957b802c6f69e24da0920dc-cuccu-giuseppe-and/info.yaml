abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning, applied to vision-based problems like Atari
  games, maps pixels directly to actions; internally, the deep neural network bears
  the responsibility of both extracting useful information and making decisions based
  on it. By separating the image processing from decision-making, one could better
  understand the complexity of each task, as well as potentially find smaller policy
  representations that are easier for humans to understand and may generalize better.
  To this end, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations
  separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning.
  State representations are generated by an encoder based on two novel algorithms:
  Increasing Dictionary Vector Quantization makes the encoder capable of growing its
  dictionary size over time, to address new observations as they appear in an open-ended
  online-learning context; Direct Residuals Sparse Coding encodes observations by
  disregarding reconstruction error minimization, and aiming instead for highest information
  inclusion. The encoder autonomously selects observations online to train on, in
  order to maximize code sparsity. As the dictionary size increases, the encoder produces
  increasingly larger inputs for the neural network: this is addressed by a variation
  of the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm which adapts its probability
  distribution dimensionality along the run. We test our system on a selection of
  Atari games using tiny neural networks of only 6 to 18 neurons (depending on the
  game''s controls). These are still capable of achieving results comparable---and
  occasionally superior---to state-of-the-art techniques which use two orders of magnitude
  more neurons.'
