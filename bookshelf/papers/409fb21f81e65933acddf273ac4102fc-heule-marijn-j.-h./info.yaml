abstract: 'The boolean Pythagorean Triples problem has been a longstanding open problem
  in Ramsey Theory: Can the set N = $\{1, 2, ...\}$ of natural numbers be divided
  into two parts, such that no part contains a triple $(a,b,c)$ with $a^2 + b^2 =
  c^2$ ? A prize for the solution was offered by Ronald Graham over two decades ago.   We
  solve this problem, proving in fact the impossibility, by using the Cube-and-Conquer
  paradigm, a hybrid SAT method for hard problems, employing both look-ahead and CDCL
  solvers. An important role is played by dedicated look-ahead heuristics, which indeed
  allowed to solve the problem on a cluster with 800 cores in about 2 days.   Due
  to the general interest in this mathematical problem, our result requires a formal
  proof. Exploiting recent progress in unsatisfiability proofs of SAT solvers, we
  produced and verified a proof in the DRAT format, which is almost 200 terabytes
  in size. From this we extracted and made available a compressed certificate of 68
  gigabytes, that allows anyone to reconstruct the DRAT proof for checking.'
