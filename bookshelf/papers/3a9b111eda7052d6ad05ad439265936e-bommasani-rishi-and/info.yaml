abstract: AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E,
  GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range
  of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their
  critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account
  of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities
  (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g.,
  model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory)
  to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g.,
  inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations).
  Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning,
  their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across
  so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage
  but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all
  the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation
  models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail,
  and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these
  questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require
  deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical
  nature.
