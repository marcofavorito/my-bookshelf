abstract: 'We propose to study proof search from a coinductive point of view. In this
  paper, we consider intuitionistic logic and a focused system based on Herbelin''s
  LJT for the implicational fragment. We introduce a variant of lambda calculus with
  potentially infinitely deep terms and a means of expressing alternatives for the
  description of the "solution spaces" (called B\"ohm forests), which are a representation
  of all (not necessarily well-founded but still locally well-formed) proofs of a
  given formula (more generally: of a given sequent).   As main result we obtain,
  for each given formula, the reduction of a coinductive definition of the solution
  space to a effective coinductive description in a finitary term calculus with a
  formal greatest fixed-point operator. This reduction works in a quite direct manner
  for the case of Horn formulas. For the general case, the naive extension would not
  even be true. We need to study "co-contraction" of contexts (contraction bottom-up)
  for dealing with the varying contexts needed beyond the Horn fragment, and we point
  out the appropriate finitary calculus, where fixed-point variables are typed with
  sequents. Co-contraction enters the interpretation of the formal greatest fixed
  points - curiously in the semantic interpretation of fixed-point variables and not
  of the fixed-point operator.'
