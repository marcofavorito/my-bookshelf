abstract: 'Almost a year has gone by since I sat down and decided to take on Byzantine
  fault tolerance protocols,

  starting with its poster child PBFT. Despite countless reprintings and re-readings
  the OSDI’99 version of the

  paper, I never stop learning new things at every reread. This is party exacerbated
  by the fact that

  Hyperledger Fabric, an open source permissioned blockchain system, contains a Go
  implementation of PBFT which

  serves as the basis for truly understanding the protocol. Discrepancies between
  the implementation and the

  paper bring the protocol’s internal intricacies out to the surface. The following
  summarizes few subtleties I

  discovered.'
