abstract: <jats:p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the main types of
  neural networks used for image recognition and classification. CNNs have several
  uses, some of which are object recognition, image processing, computer vision, and
  face recognition. Input for convolutional neural networks is provided through images.
  Convolutional neural networks are used to automatically learn a hierarchy of features
  that can then be utilized for classification, as opposed to manually creating features.
  In achieving this, a hierarchy of feature maps is constructed by iteratively convolving
  the input image with learned filters. Because of the hierarchical method, higher
  layers can learn more intricate features that are also distortion and translation
  invariant. The main goals of this study are to help academics understand where there
  are research gaps and to talk in-depth about CNN’s building blocks, their roles,
  and other vital issues.</jats:p>
