abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to train decision-making
  models in complex environments. However, RL can be slow as it requires repeated
  interaction with a simulation of the environment. In particular, there are key system
  engineering bottlenecks when using RL in complex environments that feature multiple
  agents with high-dimensional state, observation, or action spaces. We present WarpDrive,
  a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source RL framework that implements
  end-to-end deep multi-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), built
  on PyCUDA and PyTorch. Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, WarpDrive
  enables orders-of-magnitude faster RL compared to common implementations that blend
  CPU simulations and GPU models. Our design runs simulations and the agents in each
  simulation in parallel. It eliminates data copying between CPU and GPU. It also
  uses a single simulation data store on the GPU that is safely updated in-place.
  WarpDrive provides a lightweight Python interface and flexible environment wrappers
  that are easy to use and extend. Together, this allows the user to easily run thousands
  of concurrent multi-agent simulations and train on extremely large batches of experience.
  Through extensive experiments, we verify that WarpDrive provides high-throughput
  and scales almost linearly to many agents and parallel environments. For example,
  WarpDrive yields 2.9 million environment steps/second with 2000 environments and
  1000 agents (at least 100x higher throughput compared to a CPU implementation) in
  a benchmark Tag simulation. As such, WarpDrive is a fast and extensible multi-agent
  RL platform to significantly accelerate research and development.
