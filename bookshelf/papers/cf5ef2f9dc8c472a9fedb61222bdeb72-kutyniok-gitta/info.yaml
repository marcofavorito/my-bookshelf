abstract: We currently witness the spectacular success of artificial intelligence
  in both science and public life. However, the development of a rigorous mathematical
  foundation is still at an early stage. In this survey article, which is based on
  an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2022, we will
  in particular focus on the current "workhorse" of artificial intelligence, namely
  deep neural networks. We will present the main theoretical directions along with
  several exemplary results and discuss key open problems.
