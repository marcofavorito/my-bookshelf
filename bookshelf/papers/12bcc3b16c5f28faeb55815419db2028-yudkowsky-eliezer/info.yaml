abstract: 'Rationality: A-Z (or "The Sequences") is a series of blog posts by Eliezer
  Yudkowsky on human rationality and irrationality in cognitive science. It is an
  edited and reorganized version of posts published to Less Wrong and Overcoming Bias
  between 2006 and 2009. This collection serves as a long-form introduction to formative
  ideas behind Less Wrong, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Center
  for Applied Rationality, and substantial parts of the effective altruist community.
  Each book also comes with an introduction by Rob Bensinger and a supplemental essay
  by Yudkowsky.


  The first two books, Map and Territory and How to Actually Change Your Mind, are
  available on Amazon (printed and e-book version).


  The entire collection is available as an e-book and audiobook. A number of alternative
  reading orders for the essays can be found here, and a compilation of all of Eliezer\''s
  blogposts up to 2010 can be found here.'
