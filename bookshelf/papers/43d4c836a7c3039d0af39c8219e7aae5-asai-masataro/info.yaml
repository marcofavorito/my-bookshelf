abstract: Recently, there is an increasing interest in obtaining the relational structures
  of the environment in the Reinforcement Learning community. However, the resulting
  "relations" are not the discrete, logical predicates compatible to the symbolic
  reasoning such as classical planning or goal recognition. Meanwhile, Latplan (Asai
  and Fukunaga 2018) bridged the gap between deep-learning perceptual systems and
  symbolic classical planners. One key component of the system is a Neural Network
  called State AutoEncoder (SAE), which encodes an image-based input into a propositional
  representation compatible to classical planning. To get the best of both worlds,
  we propose First-Order State AutoEncoder, an unsupervised architecture for grounding
  the first-order logic predicates and facts. Each predicate models a relationship
  between objects by taking the interpretable arguments and returning a propositional
  value. In the experiment using 8-Puzzle and a photo-realistic Blocksworld environment,
  we show that (1) the resulting predicates capture the interpretable relations (e.g.
  spatial), (2) they help obtaining the compact, abstract model of the environment,
  and finally, (3) the resulting model is compatible to symbolic classical planning.
