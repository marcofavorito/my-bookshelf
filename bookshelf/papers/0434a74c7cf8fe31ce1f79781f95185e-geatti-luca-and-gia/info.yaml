abstract: This paper studies Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces (LTLf) where
  proposition letters are replaced with first-order formulas interpreted over arbitrary
  theories, in the spirit of Satisfiability Modulo Theories. The resulting logic,
  called LTLf Modulo Theories (LTLfMT), is semi-decidable. Nevertheless, its high
  expressiveness comes useful in a number of use cases, such as model-checking of
  data-aware processes and data-aware planning. Despite the general undecidability
  of these problems, being able to solve satisfiable instances is a compromise worth
  studying. After motivating and describing such use cases, we provide a sound and
  complete semi-decision procedure for LTLfMT based on the SMT encoding of a one-pass
  tree-shaped tableau system. The algorithm is implemented in the BLACK satisfiability
  checking tool, and an experimental evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach
  on novel benchmarks.
