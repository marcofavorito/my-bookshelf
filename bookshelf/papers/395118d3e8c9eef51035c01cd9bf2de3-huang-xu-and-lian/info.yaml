abstract: Recommender models excel at providing domain-specific item recommendations
  by leveraging extensive user behavior data. Despite their ability to act as lightweight
  domain experts, they struggle to perform versatile tasks such as providing explanations
  and engaging in conversations. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) represent
  a significant step towards artificial general intelligence, showcasing remarkable
  capabilities in instruction comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and human interaction.
  However, LLMs lack the knowledge of domain-specific item catalogs and behavioral
  patterns, particularly in areas that diverge from general world knowledge, such
  as online e-commerce. Finetuning LLMs for each domain is neither economic nor efficient.   In
  this paper, we bridge the gap between recommender models and LLMs, combining their
  respective strengths to create a versatile and interactive recommender system. We
  introduce an efficient framework called InteRecAgent, which employs LLMs as the
  brain and recommender models as tools. We first outline a minimal set of essential
  tools required to transform LLMs into InteRecAgent. We then propose an efficient
  workflow within InteRecAgent for task execution, incorporating key components such
  as a memory bus, dynamic demonstration-augmented task planning, and reflection.
  InteRecAgent enables traditional recommender systems, such as those ID-based matrix
  factorization models, to become interactive systems with a natural language interface
  through the integration of LLMs. Experimental results on several public datasets
  show that InteRecAgent achieves satisfying performance as a conversational recommender
  system, outperforming general-purpose LLMs.
