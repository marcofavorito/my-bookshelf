abstract: Bonding curves are continuous liquidity mechanisms which are used in market
  design for cryptographically-supported token economies. Tokens are atomic units
  of state information which are cryptographically verifiable in peer-to-peer networks.
  Bonding curves are an example of an enforceable mechanism through which participating
  agents influence this state. By designing such mechanisms, an engineer may establish
  the topological structure of a token economy without presupposing the utilities
  or associated actions of the agents within that economy. This is accomplished by
  introducing configuration spaces, which are proper subsets of the global state space
  representing all achievable states under the designed mechanisms. Any global properties
  true for all points in the configuration space are true for all possible sequences
  of actions on the part of agents. This paper generalizes the notion of a bonding
  curve to formalize the relationship between cryptographically enforced mechanisms
  and their associated configuration spaces, using invariant properties of conservation
  functions. We then proceed to apply this framework to analyze the augmented bonding
  curve design, which is currently under development by a project in the non-profit
  funding sector.
