abstract: This paper investigates the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems
  modeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition probabilities
  over continuous state and action spaces. Linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to
  specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be converted into a limit
  deterministic generalized B\"uchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets.
  The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and
  the MDP by incorporating a synchronous tracking-frontier function to record unvisited
  accepting sets of the automaton, and to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting
  conditions. The proposed LDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for
  the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and
  can overcome the issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method
  that optimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal policy
  whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep deterministic
  policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such policies over continuous
  state and action spaces. The performance of our framework is evaluated via an array
  of OpenAI gym environments.
