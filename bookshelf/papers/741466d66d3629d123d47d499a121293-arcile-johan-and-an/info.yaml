abstract: Timed automata are a common formalism for the verification of concurrent
  systems subject to timing constraints. They extend finite-state automata with clocks,
  that constrain the system behavior in locations, and to take transitions. While
  timed automata were originally designed for safety (in the wide sense of correctness
  w.r.t. a formal property), they were progressively used in a number of works to
  guarantee security properties. In this work, we review works studying security properties
  for timed automata in the last two decades. We notably review theoretical works,
  with a particular focus on opacity, as well as more practical works, with a particular
  focus on attack trees and their extensions. We derive main conclusions concerning
  open perspectives, as well as tool support.
