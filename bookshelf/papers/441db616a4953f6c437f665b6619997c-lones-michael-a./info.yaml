abstract: 'This document is a concise outline of some of the common mistakes that
  occur when using machine learning, and what can be done to avoid them. Whilst it
  should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning techniques,
  it was originally written for research students, and focuses on issues that are
  of particular concern within academic research, such as the need to do rigorous
  comparisons and reach valid conclusions. It covers five stages of the machine learning
  process: what to do before model building, how to reliably build models, how to
  robustly evaluate models, how to compare models fairly, and how to report results.'
