abstract: Before atomic timekeeping, clocks were set to the skies. But starting in
  1972, radio signals began broadcasting atomic seconds and leap seconds have occasionally
  been added to that stream of atomic seconds to keep the signals synchronized with
  the actual rotation of Earth. Such adjustments were considered necessary because
  Earth's rotation is less regular than atomic timekeeping. In January 2012, a United
  Nations-affiliated organization could permanently break this link by redefining
  Coordinated Universal Time. To understand the importance of this potential change,
  it's important to understand the history of human timekeeping.
