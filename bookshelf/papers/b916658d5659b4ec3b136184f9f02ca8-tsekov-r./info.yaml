abstract: Financial market dynamics is rigorously studied via the exact generalized
  Langevin equation. Assuming market Brownian self-similarity, the market return rate
  memory and autocorrelation functions are derived, which exhibit an oscillatory-decaying
  behavior with a long-time tail, similar to empirical observations. Individual stocks
  are also described via the generalized Langevin equation. They are classified by
  their relation to the market memory as heavy, neutral and light stocks, possessing
  different kinds of autocorrelation functions.
