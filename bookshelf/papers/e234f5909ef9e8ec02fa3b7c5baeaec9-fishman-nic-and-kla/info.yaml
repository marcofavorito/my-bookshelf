abstract: Denoising diffusion models have recently emerged as the predominant paradigm
  for generative modelling on image domains. In addition, their extension to Riemannian
  manifolds has facilitated a range of applications across the natural sciences. While
  many of these problems stand to benefit from the ability to specify arbitrary, domain-informed
  constraints, this setting is not covered by the existing (Riemannian) diffusion
  model methodology. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by constructing
  novel noising processes based on the reflected Brownian motion and logarithmic barrier
  methods. However, the associated samplers are either computationally burdensome
  or only apply to convex subsets of Euclidean space. In this paper, we introduce
  an alternative, simple noising scheme based on Metropolis sampling that affords
  substantial gains in computational efficiency and empirical performance compared
  to the earlier samplers. Of independent interest, we prove that this new process
  corresponds to a valid discretisation of the reflected Brownian motion. We demonstrate
  the scalability and flexibility of our approach on a range of problem settings with
  convex and non-convex constraints, including applications from geospatial modelling,
  robotics and protein design.
