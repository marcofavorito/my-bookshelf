abstract: This paper revisits the ubiquitous problem of achieving state machine replication
  in blockchains based on repeated consensus, like Tendermint. To achieve state machine
  replication in blockchains built on top of consensus, one needs to guarantee fairness
  of user transactions. A huge body of work has been carried out on the relation between
  state machine replication and consensus in the past years, in a variety of system
  models and with respect to varied problem specifications. We systematize this work
  by proposing novel and rigorous abstractions for state machine replication and repeated
  consensus in a system model that accounts for realistic blockchains in which blocks
  may contain several transactions issued by one or more users, and where validity
  and order of transactions within a block is determined by an external application-dependent
  function that can capture various approaches for order-fairness in the literature.
  Based on these abstractions, we propose a reduction from state machine replication
  to repeated consensus, such that user fairness is achieved using the consensus module
  as a black box. This approach allows to achieve fairness as an add-on on top of
  preexisting consensus modules in blockchains based on repeated consensus.
