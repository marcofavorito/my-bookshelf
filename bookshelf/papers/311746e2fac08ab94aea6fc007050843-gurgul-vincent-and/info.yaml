abstract: This paper explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural
  Language Processing (NLP) techniques in cryptocurrency price forecasting, specifically
  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Focusing on news and social media data, primarily
  from Twitter and Reddit, we analyse the influence of public sentiment on cryptocurrency
  valuations using advanced deep learning NLP methods. Alongside conventional price
  regression, we treat cryptocurrency price forecasting as a classification problem.
  This includes both the prediction of price movements (up or down) and the identification
  of local extrema. We compare the performance of various ML models, both with and
  without NLP data integration. Our findings reveal that incorporating NLP data significantly
  enhances the forecasting performance of our models. We discover that pre-trained
  models, such as Twitter-RoBERTa and BART MNLI, are highly effective in capturing
  market sentiment, and that fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) also yields
  substantial forecasting improvements. Notably, the BART MNLI zero-shot classification
  model shows considerable proficiency in extracting bullish and bearish signals from
  textual data. All of our models consistently generate profit across different validation
  scenarios, with no observed decline in profits or reduction in the impact of NLP
  data over time. The study highlights the potential of text analysis in improving
  financial forecasts and demonstrates the effectiveness of various NLP techniques
  in capturing nuanced market sentiment.
