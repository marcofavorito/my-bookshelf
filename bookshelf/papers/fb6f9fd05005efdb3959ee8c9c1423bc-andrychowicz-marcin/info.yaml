abstract: 'Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement
  Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which
  allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore
  avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary
  off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum.   We demonstrate
  our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular,
  we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place,
  in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed.
  Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient
  which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our
  policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and
  successfully complete the task.'
