abstract: Thomas Sowell “both surprises and overturns received wisdom” in this indispensable
  examination of widespread economic fallacies (The Economist)Economic Facts and Fallacies
  exposes some of the most popular fallacies about economic issues-and does so in
  a lively manner and without requiring any prior knowledge of economics by the reader.
  These include many beliefs widely disseminated in the media and by politicians,
  such as mistaken ideas about urban problems, income differences, male-female economic
  differences, as well as economics fallacies about academia, about race, and about
  Third World countries. One of the themes of Economic Facts and Fallacies is that
  fallacies are not simply crazy ideas but in fact have a certain plausibility that
  gives them their staying power-and makes careful examination of their flaws both
  necessary and important, as well as sometimes humorous. Written in the easy-to-follow
  style of the author's Basic Economics, this latest book is able to go into greater
  depth, with real world examples, on specific issues.
