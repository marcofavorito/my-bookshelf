abstract: In this semi-tutorial paper, we first review the information-theoretic approach
  to account for the computational costs incurred during the search for optimal actions
  in a sequential decision-making problem. The traditional (MDP) framework ignores
  computational limitations while searching for optimal policies, essentially assuming
  that the acting agent is perfectly rational and aims for exact optimality. Using
  the free-energy, a variational principle is introduced that accounts not only for
  the value of a policy alone, but also considers the cost of finding this optimal
  policy. The solution of the variational equations arising from this formulation
  can be obtained using familiar Bellman-like value iterations from dynamic programming
  (DP) and the Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm from rate distortion theory. Finally,
  we demonstrate the utility of the approach for generating hierarchies of state abstractions
  that can be used to best exploit the available computational resources. A numerical
  example showcases these concepts for a path-planning problem in a grid world environment.
