abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is arguably the archetypical NP-complete decision
  problem. Progress in SAT solving algorithms has motivated an ever increasing number
  of practical applications in recent years. However, many practical uses of SAT involve
  solving function as opposed to decision problems. Concrete examples include computing
  minimal unsatisfiable subsets, minimal correction subsets, prime implicates and
  implicants, minimal models, backbone literals, and autarkies, among several others.
  In most cases, solving a function problem requires a number of adaptive or non-adaptive
  calls to a SAT solver. Given the computational complexity of SAT, it is therefore
  important to develop algorithms that either require the smallest possible number
  of calls to the SAT solver, or that involve simpler instances. This paper addresses
  a number of representative function problems defined on Boolean formulas, and shows
  that all these function problems can be reduced to a generic problem of computing
  a minimal set subject to a monotone predicate. This problem is referred to as the
  Minimal Set over Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem. This exercise provides new ways
  for solving well-known function problems, including prime implicates, minimal correction
  subsets, backbone literals, independent variables and autarkies, among several others.
  Moreover, this exercise motivates the development of more efficient algorithms for
  the MSMP problem. Finally the paper outlines a number of areas of future research
  related with extensions of the MSMP problem.
