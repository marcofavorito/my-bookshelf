abstract: Gaussian processes~(Kriging) are interpolating data-driven models that are
  frequently applied in various disciplines. Often, Gaussian processes are trained
  on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems.
  These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired. However,
  previous literature observed computational burdens limiting deterministic global
  optimization to Gaussian processes trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space
  formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes
  embedded. For optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the degrees
  of freedom and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process
  models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper
  subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence, we
  derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of
  acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement,
  probability of improvement, and lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational
  time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus overcoming
  previous computational burdens. We demonstrate the performance and scaling of the
  proposed method and apply it to Bayesian optimization with global optimization of
  the acquisition function and chance-constrained programming. The Gaussian process
  models, acquisition functions, and training scripts are available open-source within
  the "MeLOn - Machine Learning Models for Optimization" toolbox~(https://git.rwth-aachen.de/avt.svt/public/MeLOn).
