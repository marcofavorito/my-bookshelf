abstract: The increasing application of process-oriented approaches in new challenging
  dynamic domains beyond business computing (e.g., healthcare, emergency management,
  factories of the future, home automation, etc.) has led to reconsider the level
  of flexibility and support required to manage complex knowledge-intensive processes
  in such domains. A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making
  and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing
  complex tasks in the “physical” real world to achieve a common goal. The physical
  world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledge-intensive processes must
  be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing
  that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery
  activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To
  tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process
  Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated
  adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able
  to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without
  explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention
  of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc
  changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish
  this, we make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial
  Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The
  approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated
  with a case study based on real knowledge-intensive processes coming from an emergency
  management domain.
