abstract: The field of Sequential Decision Making (SDM) provides tools for solving
  Sequential Decision Processes (SDPs), where an agent must make a series of decisions
  in order to complete a task or achieve a goal. Historically, two competing SDM paradigms
  have view for supremacy. Automated Planning (AP) proposes to solve SDPs by performing
  a reasoning process over a model of the world, often represented symbolically. Conversely,
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) proposes to learn the solution of the SDP from data,
  without a world model, and represent the learned knowledge subsymbolically. In the
  spirit of reconciliation, we provide a review of symbolic, subsymbolic and hybrid
  methods for SDM. We cover both methods for solving SDPs (e.g., AP, RL and techniques
  that learn to plan) and for learning aspects of their structure (e.g., world models,
  state invariants and landmarks). To the best of our knowledge, no other review in
  the field provides the same scope. As an additional contribution, we discuss what
  properties an ideal method for SDM should exhibit and argue that neurosymbolic AI
  is the current approach which most closely resembles this ideal method. Finally,
  we outline several proposals to advance the field of SDM via the integration of
  symbolic and subsymbolic AI.
