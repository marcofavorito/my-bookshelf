abstract: This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with
  reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing
  a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling
  external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations
  separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations.
  While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented
  LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context
  processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We
  therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective
  allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing
  standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several
  benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that
  this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional
  LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.
