abstract: In recent years, blockchain technology has received unparalleled attention
  from academia, industry, and governments all around the world. It is considered
  a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application domains.
  This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However,
  many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their
  performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption
  can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying
  consensus algorithm, which in many ways, determines its performance and security.
  Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing
  as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of
  these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs
  the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus algorithms are
  not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on the properties of
  the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain consensus algorithms
  in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by analysing a wide range
  of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties and by examining
  the implications of different issues still prevalent in consensus algorithms in
  detail. The result of the analysis is presented in tabular formats, which provides
  a visual illustration of these algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed
  more than hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus
  algorithms to understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these
  crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to be
  used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under different criteria.
