abstract: An algorithm is described which guarantees reliable storage of data in a
  distributed system, even when different portions of the data base, stored on separate
  machines, are updated as part of a single transaction. The algorithm is implemented
  by a hierarchy of rather simple abstractions, and it works properly regardless of
  crashes of the client or servers. Some care is taken to state precisely the assumptions
  about the physical components of the system (storage, processors and communication).
