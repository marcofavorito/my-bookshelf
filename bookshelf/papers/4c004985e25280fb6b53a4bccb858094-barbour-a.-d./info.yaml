abstract: <jats:p>Generalized semi-Markov schemes were devised to give a versatile
  general model embracing queueing networks and similar systems of practical importance,
  and they have proved particularly successful in uniting many disparate results on
  insensitivity. However, it turns out that, although closed queueing networks are
  expressible as GSMS, open networks are not, and that the insensitivity results for
  such networks are not therefore strictly within their scope. In this paper, it is
  shown that, as one might hope, open networks can be realized as limits of a suitable
  sequence of closed networks in such a way that the insensitivity properties of the
  GSMS are transferred to the open network in the limit, and thus that open networks
  too can, in a sense, be considered to be GSMS. However, it appears from the technical
  nature of the arguments involved that, despite this close relationship between GSMS
  and open networks, it may nonetheless be simpler to treat them separately when constructing
  the proofs of theorems.</jats:p>
