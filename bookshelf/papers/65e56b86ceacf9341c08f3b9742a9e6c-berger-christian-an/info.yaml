abstract: With upcoming blockchain infrastructures, world-spanning Byzantine consensus
  is getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the pace
  at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogenous latencies of connections
  between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network, consensus-based systems benefit
  from weighted replication, an approach that utilizes extra replicas and assigns
  higher voting power to well connected replicas. This enables more choice in quorum
  formation and replicas can leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus
  decreasing consensus latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously
  adjust to its environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present
  Adaptive Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical
  scalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world. Essentially,
  AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader positioning scheme,
  which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system. It employs a reliable
  self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model seeking to minimize the
  system's consensus latency. In experiments using several AWS EC2 regions, AWARE
  dynamically optimizes consensus latency by self-reliantly finding a fast weight
  configuration yielding latency gains observed by clients located across the globe.
