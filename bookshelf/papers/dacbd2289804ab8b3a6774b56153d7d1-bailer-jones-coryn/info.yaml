abstract: The exploration of interstellar space will require autonomous navigation
  systems that do not rely on tracking from the Earth. Here I develop a method to
  determine the 3D position and 3D velocity of a spacecraft in deep space using a
  star catalogue. As a spacecraft moves away from the Sun, the observed positions
  and velocities of the stars will change relative to those in a Earth-based catalogue
  due to parallax, aberration, and the Doppler effect. By measuring just the angular
  distances between pairs of stars, and comparing these to the catalogue, we can infer
  the coordinates of the spacecraft via an iterative forward-modelling process. I
  perform simulations with existing star catalogues to demonstrate the method and
  to compute its performance. Using 20 stars and a modest angular distance measurement
  accuracy of 1", the position and velocity of the spacecraft can be determined to
  within 3 au and 2 km/s respectively. If a measurement accuracy of 1 mas is achievable
  then the navigation accuracy increases by a factor of 1000. Using more stars and/or
  including also onboard measurements of the stars' radial velocities improves the
  accuracy further.
