abstract: A public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented
  by everyone. Public ledgers have innumerable and compelling uses. They can secure,
  in plain sight, all kinds of transactions ---such as titles, sales, and payments---
  in the exact order in which they occur. Public ledgers not only curb corruption,
  but also enable very sophisticated applications ---such as cryptocurrencies and
  smart contracts. They stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates.
  As currently implemented, however, they scale poorly and cannot achieve their potential.   Algorand
  is a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior
  implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation,
  and generates a transaction history that will not "fork" with overwhelmingly high
  probability.   Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) message-passing Byzantine
  agreement.   For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a money platform.
