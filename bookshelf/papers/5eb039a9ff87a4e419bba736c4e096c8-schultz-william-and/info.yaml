abstract: We present a new technique for automatically inferring inductive invariants
  of parameterized distributed protocols specified in TLA+. Ours is the first such
  invariant inference technique to work directly on TLA+, an expressive, high level
  specification language. To achieve this, we present a new algorithm for invariant
  inference that is based around a core procedure for generating plain, potentially
  non-inductive lemma invariants that are used as candidate conjuncts of an overall
  inductive invariant. We couple this with a greedy lemma invariant selection procedure
  that selects lemmas that eliminate the largest number of counterexamples to induction
  at each round of our inference procedure. We have implemented our algorithm in a
  tool, endive, and evaluate it on a diverse set of distributed protocol benchmarks,
  demonstrating competitive performance and ability to uniquely solve an industrial
  scale reconfiguration protocol.
