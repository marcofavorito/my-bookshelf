abstract: We characterise the problem of abstraction in the context of deep reinforcement
  learning. Various well established approaches to analogical reasoning and associative
  memory might be brought to bear on this issue, but they present difficulties because
  of the need for end-to-end differentiability. We review developments in AI and machine
  learning that could facilitate their adoption.
