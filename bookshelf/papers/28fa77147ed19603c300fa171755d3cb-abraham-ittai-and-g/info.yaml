abstract: In this note, we observe a safety violation in Zyzzyva and a liveness violation
  in FaB. To demonstrate these issues, we require relatively simple scenarios, involving
  only four replicas, and one or two view changes. In all of them, the problem is
  manifested already in the first log slot.
