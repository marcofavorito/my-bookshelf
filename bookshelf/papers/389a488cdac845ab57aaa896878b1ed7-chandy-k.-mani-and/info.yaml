abstract: '<jats:p>This paper presents an algorithm by which a process in a distributed
  system determines a global state of the system during a computation. Many problems
  in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states.
  For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class
  of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists:
  once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable
  properties are “computation has terminated,” “ the system is deadlocked” and “all
  tokens in a token ring have disappeared.” The stable property detection problem
  is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection
  can also be used for checkpointing.</jats:p>'
