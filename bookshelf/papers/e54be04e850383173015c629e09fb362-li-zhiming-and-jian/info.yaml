abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative finance
  by achieving excellent performance without significant manual effort. Whereas we
  observe that the DRL models behave unstably in a dynamic stock market due to the
  low signal-to-noise ratio nature of the financial data. In this paper, we propose
  a novel logic-guided trading framework, termed as SYENS (Program Synthesis-based
  Ensemble Strategy). Different from the previous state-of-the-art ensemble reinforcement
  learning strategy which arbitrarily selects the best-performing agent for testing
  based on a single measurement, our framework proposes regularizing the model's behavior
  in a hierarchical manner using the program synthesis by sketching paradigm. First,
  we propose a high-level, domain-specific language (DSL) that is used for the depiction
  of the market environment and action. Then based on the DSL, a novel program sketch
  is introduced, which embeds human expert knowledge in a logical manner. Finally,
  based on the program sketch, we adopt the program synthesis by sketching a paradigm
  and synthesizing a logical, hierarchical trading strategy. We evaluate SYENS on
  the 30 Dow Jones stocks under the cash trading and the margin trading settings.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly outperform
  the baselines with much higher cumulative return and lower maximum drawdown under
  both settings.
