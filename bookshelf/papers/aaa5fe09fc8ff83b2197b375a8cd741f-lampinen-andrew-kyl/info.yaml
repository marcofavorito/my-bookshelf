abstract: What can be learned about causality and experimentation from passive data?
  This question is salient given recent successes of passively-trained language models
  in interactive domains such as tool use. Passive learning is inherently limited.
  However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an agent to learn
  generalizable strategies for determining and using causal structures, as long as
  the agent can intervene at test time. We formally illustrate that learning a strategy
  of first experimenting, then seeking goals, can allow generalization from passive
  learning in principle. We then show empirically that agents trained via imitation
  on expert data can indeed generalize at test time to infer and use causal links
  which are never present in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation
  strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that
  strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from passive
  data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional observations, with
  the support of natural language explanations. Explanations can even allow passive
  learners to generalize out-of-distribution from perfectly-confounded training data.
  Finally, we show that language models, trained only on passive next-word prediction,
  can generalize causal intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing
  examples of experimentation, together with explanations and reasoning. These results
  highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies,
  and may help to understand the behaviors and capabilities of language models.
