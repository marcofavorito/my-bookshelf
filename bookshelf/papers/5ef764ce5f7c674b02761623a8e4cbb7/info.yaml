abstract: I've often found myself grappling with the challenge of articulating what
  'Ethereum alignment' really means, especially when put on the spot. It's one of
  those elusive concepts that feels intrinsically significant-almost second nature,
  if you will. Yet, when it comes to putting it into words, the clarity I thought
  I had vanishes. This realization compelled me to sit down and methodically organize
  my thoughts on the subject. My aim is to articulate what 'Ethereum alignment' means
  to me, particularly when I'm advocating for its importance.
