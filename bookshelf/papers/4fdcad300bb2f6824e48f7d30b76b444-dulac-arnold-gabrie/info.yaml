abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial
  domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However,
  much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems
  due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present
  a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real
  world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the
  challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics
  for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would
  be applicable to a large number of real world problems. We also present an example
  domain that has been modified to present these challenges as a testbed for practical
  RL research.
