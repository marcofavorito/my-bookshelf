abstract: 'We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations
  in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links. The success of such a task heavily
  relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or between) the
  relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding
  called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including:
  symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model
  defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity
  in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative
  sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental
  results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model
  is not only scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns
  and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.'
