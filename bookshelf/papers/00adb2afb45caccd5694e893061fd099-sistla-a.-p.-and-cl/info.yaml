abstract: <jats:p>The complexity of satisfiability and determination of truth in a
  particular finite structure are considered for different propositional linear temporal
  logics. It is shown that these problems are NP-complete for the logic with F and
  are PSPACE-complete for the logics with F, X, with U, with U, S, X operators and
  for the extended logic with regular operators given by Wolper.</jats:p>
