abstract: In this paper, we investigate finite representations of DatalogMTL. First,
  we introduce programs that have finite models and propose a toolkit for structuring
  the execution of DatalogMTL rules into sequential phases. Then, we study infinite
  models that eventually become constant and introduce sufficient criteria for programs
  that allow for such representation. We proceed by considering infinite models that
  are eventually periodic and show that such a representation encompasses all DatalogMTLFP
  programs, a widely discussed fragment. Finally, we provide a novel algorithm for
  reasoning over finite representable DatalogMTL programs that incorporates all of
  the previously discussed representations.
