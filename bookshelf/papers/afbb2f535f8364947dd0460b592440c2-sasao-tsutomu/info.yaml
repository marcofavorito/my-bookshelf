abstract: 'From the Publisher:Switching Theory for Logic Synthesis covers the basic
  topics of switching theory and logic synthesis in fourteen chapters. Chapters 1
  through 5 provide the mathematical foundation. Chapters 6 through 8 include an introduction
  to sequential circuits, optimization of sequential machines and asynchronous sequential
  circuits. Chapters 9 through 14 are the main feature of the book. These chapters
  introduce and explain various topics that make up the subject of logic synthesis:
  multi-valued input two-valued output function, logic design for PLDs/FPGAs, EXOR-based
  design, and complexity theories of logic networks. An appendix providing a history
  of switching theory is included. The reference list consists of over four hundred
  entries.Switching Theory for Logic Synthesis is based on the author''s lectures
  at Kyushu Institute of Technology as well as seminars for CAD engineers from various
  Japanese technology companies.Switching Theory for Logic Synthesis will be of interest
  to CAD professionals and students at the advanced level. It is also useful as a
  textbook, as each chapter contains examples, illustrations, and exercises.'
