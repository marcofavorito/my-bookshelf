abstract: 'This paper covers two topics: first an introduction to Algorithmic Complexity
  Theory: how it defines probability, some of its characteristic properties and past
  successful applications. Second, we apply it to problems in A.I. - where it promises
  to give near optimum search procedures for two very broad classes of problems.'
