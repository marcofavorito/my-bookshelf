abstract: Understanding properties of deep neural networks is an important challenge
  in deep learning. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by proposing a
  rigorous way of verifying properties of a popular class of neural networks, Binarized
  Neural Networks, using the well-developed means of Boolean satisfiability. Our main
  contribution is a construction that creates a representation of a binarized neural
  network as a Boolean formula. Our encoding is the first exact Boolean representation
  of a deep neural network. Using this encoding, we leverage the power of modern SAT
  solvers along with a proposed counterexample-guided search procedure to verify various
  properties of these networks. A particular focus will be on the critical property
  of robustness to adversarial perturbations. For this property, our experimental
  results demonstrate that our approach scales to medium-size deep neural networks
  used in image classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work on verifying properties of deep neural networks using an exact Boolean encoding
  of the network.
