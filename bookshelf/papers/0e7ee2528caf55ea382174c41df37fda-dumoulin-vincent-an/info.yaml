abstract: We introduce a guide to help deep learning practitioners understand and
  manipulate convolutional neural network architectures. The guide clarifies the relationship
  between various properties (input shape, kernel shape, zero padding, strides and
  output shape) of convolutional, pooling and transposed convolutional layers, as
  well as the relationship between convolutional and transposed convolutional layers.
  Relationships are derived for various cases, and are illustrated in order to make
  them intuitive.
