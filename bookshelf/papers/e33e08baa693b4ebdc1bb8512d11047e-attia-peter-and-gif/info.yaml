abstract: 'This is the ultimate manual for living better and longer.For all its successes,
  mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of ageing
  that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer''s disease, and type 2 diabetes.
  Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late, prolonging lifespan at the expense
  of quality of life. Dr Peter Attia, the world''s top longevity expert who is featured
  on Chris Hemsworth''s National Geographic documentary LIMITLESS, believes we must
  replace this outdated framework with a personalised, proactive strategy for longevity.This
  isn''t ''biohacking,'' it''s science: a well-founded strategic approach to extending
  lifespan while improving our physical, cognitive and emotional health, making each
  decade better than the one before. With Outlive''s practical advice and roadmap,
  you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes
  to make each decade better than the one before.''One of the most important books
  you''ll ever read.'' - Steven D. Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics'
