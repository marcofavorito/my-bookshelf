abstract: 'We study synthesis of reactive systems interacting with environments using
  an infinite data domain. A popular formalism for specifying and modelling such systems
  is register automata and transducers. They extend finite-state automata by adding
  registers to store data values and to compare the incoming data values against stored
  ones. Synthesis from nondeterministic or universal register automata is undecidable
  in general. However, its register-bounded variant, where additionally a bound on
  the number of registers in a sought transducer is given, is known to be decidable
  for universal register automata which can compare data for equality, i.e., for data
  domain (N,=). This paper extends the decidability border to the domain (N,<) of
  natural numbers with linear order. Our solution is generic: we define a sufficient
  condition on data domains (regular approximability) for decidability of register-bounded
  synthesis. The condition is satisfied by natural data domains like (N,<). It allows
  one to use simple language-theoretic arguments and avoid technical game-theoretic
  reasoning. Further, by defining a generic notion of reducibility between data domains,
  we show the decidability of synthesis in the domain (N^d,<^d) of tuples of numbers
  equipped with the component-wise partial order and in the domain (\Sigma^*,\prec)
  of finite strings with the prefix relation.'
