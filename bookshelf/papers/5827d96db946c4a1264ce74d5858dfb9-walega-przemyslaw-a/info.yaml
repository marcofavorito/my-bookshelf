abstract: We study the data complexity of  reasoning for several fragments
  of MTL - an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators over the rational
  numbers. Reasoning in the full MTL language is PSPACE-complete, which handicaps
  its application in practice. To achieve tractability we first study the core fragment,
  which disallows conjunction in rule bodies, and show that reasoning remains PSPACE-hard.
  Intractability prompts us to also limit the kinds of temporal operators allowed
  in rules, and we propose a practical core fragment for which reasoning becomes TC0-complete.
  Finally, we show that this fragment can be extended by allowing linear conjunctions
  in rule bodies, where at most one atom can be intensional (IDB); we show that the
  resulting fragment is NL-complete, and hence no harder than plain linear Datalog.
