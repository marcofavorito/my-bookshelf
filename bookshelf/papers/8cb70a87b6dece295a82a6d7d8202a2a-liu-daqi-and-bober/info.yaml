abstract: 'Visual semantic information comprises two important parts: the meaning
  of each visual semantic unit and the coherent visual semantic relation conveyed
  by these visual semantic units. Essentially, the former one is a visual perception
  task while the latter one corresponds to visual context reasoning. Remarkable advances
  in visual perception have been achieved due to the success of deep learning. In
  contrast, visual semantic information pursuit, a visual scene semantic interpretation
  task combining visual perception and visual context reasoning, is still in its early
  stage. It is the core task of many different computer vision applications, such
  as object detection, visual semantic segmentation, visual relationship detection
  or scene graph generation. Since it helps to enhance the accuracy and the consistency
  of the resulting interpretation, visual context reasoning is often incorporated
  with visual perception in current deep end-to-end visual semantic information pursuit
  methods. However, a comprehensive review for this exciting area is still lacking.
  In this survey, we present a unified theoretical paradigm for all these methods,
  followed by an overview of the major developments and the future trends in each
  potential direction. The common benchmark datasets, the evaluation metrics and the
  comparisons of the corresponding methods are also introduced.'
