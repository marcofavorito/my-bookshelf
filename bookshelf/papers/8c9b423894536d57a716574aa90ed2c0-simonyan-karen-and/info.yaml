abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth
  on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution
  is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with
  very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement
  on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight
  layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission,
  where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification
  tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other
  datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing
  ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep
  visual representations in computer vision.
