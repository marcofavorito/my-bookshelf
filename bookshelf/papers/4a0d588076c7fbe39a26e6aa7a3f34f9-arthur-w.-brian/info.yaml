abstract: 'Economics is changing. In the last few years it has generated a number
  of new approaches. One of the most promising - complexity economics - was pioneered
  in the 1980s and 1990s by a small team at the Santa Fe Institute. Economist and
  complexity theorist W. Brian Arthur led that team, and in this book he collects
  many of his articles on this new approach. The traditional framework sees behavior
  in the economy as in an equilibrium steady state. People in the economy face well-defined
  problems and use perfect deductive reasoning to base their actions on. The complexity
  framework, by contrast, sees the economy as always in process, always changing.
  People try to make sense of the situations they face using whatever reasoning they
  have at hand, and together create outcomes they must individually react to anew.
  The resulting economy is not a well-ordered machine, but a complex evolving system
  that is imperfect, perpetually constructing itself anew, and brimming with vitality.
  The new vision complements and widens the standard one, and it helps answer many
  questions: Why does the stock market show moods and a psychology? Why do high-tech
  markets tend to lock in to the dominance of one or two very large players? How do
  economies form, and how do they continually alter in structure over time? The papers
  collected here were among the first to use evolutionary computation, agent-based
  modeling, and cognitive psychology. They cover topics as disparate as how markets
  form out of beliefs; how technology evolves over the long span of time; why systems
  and bureaucracies get more complicated as they evolve; and how financial crises
  can be foreseen and prevented in the future.'
