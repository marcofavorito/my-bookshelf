abstract: Battery life prediction holds significant practical value for battery research
  and development. Currently, many data-driven models rely on early electrical signals
  from specific target batteries to predict their lifespan. A common shortfall is
  that most existing methods are developed based on specific aging conditions, which
  not only limits their model's capability but also diminishes their effectiveness
  in predicting degradation under varied conditions. As a result, these models often
  miss out on fully benefiting from the rich historical data available under other
  conditions. Here, to address above, we introduce an approach that explicitly captures
  differences between electrical signals of a target battery and a reference battery,
  irrespective of their materials and aging conditions, to forecast the target battery
  life. Through this inter-cell difference, we not only enhance the feature space
  but also pave the way for a universal battery life prediction framework. Remarkably,
  our model that combines the inter- and intra-cell differences shines across diverse
  conditions, standing out in its efficiency and accuracy using all accessible datasets.
  An essential application of our approach is its capability to leverage data from
  older batteries effectively, enabling newer batteries to capitalize on insights
  gained from past batteries. This work not only enriches the battery data utilization
  strategy but also sets the stage for smarter battery management system in the future.
