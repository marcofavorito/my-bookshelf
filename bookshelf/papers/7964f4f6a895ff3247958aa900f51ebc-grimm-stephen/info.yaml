abstract: Understanding is a protean concept in philosophy, and the desire forunderstanding
  is pervasive in everyday life. Scientists take it astheir goal to understand the
  world and how it works, teachers andparents hope to transmit understanding to their
  students and children,and from a political and social point of view we often strive
  formutual understanding., This entry will look at some ways in which understanding
  has beenconceptualized by philosophersâ€”especially epistemologists,philosophers of
  science, and philosophers of social science. The focuswill be on accounts of understanding
  the natural world and otherpeople, and it will only touch occasionally on accounts
  of what ittakes to understand other items, such as concepts, languages, ortexts.
