abstract: 'I was invited to give a talk at a celebration of the 80th birthday of Richard
  Palais. It was at a celebration of his 60th birthday that I first gave a talk about
  how to write a proof--a talk that led to [101]. So, I thought it would be fun to
  give the same talk, updated to reflect my 20 years of experience writing structured
  proofs. The talk was received much more calmly than my earlier one, and the mathematicians
  were open to considering that I might have something interesting to say about writing
  proofs. Perhaps in the last 20 years I have learned to be more persuasive, or perhaps
  the mathematicians in the audience had just grown older and calmer. In any case,
  they were still not ready to try changing how they write their own proofs.


  My experience preparing and giving the talk made me realize it was time for a new
  paper on the subject. This paper is built around a simple example--a lemma from
  Michael Spivak''s calculus text. I tried to show how a mathematician can easily
  transform the proofs she now writes into structured proofs. The paper also briefly
  describes how formal structured proofs are written in TLA+, and an appendix contains
  a machine-checked proof of Spivak''s lemma. While mathematicians will not write
  formal proofs in the forseeable future, I argue that learning how to write them
  is a good way to learn how to write rigorous informal proofs.'
