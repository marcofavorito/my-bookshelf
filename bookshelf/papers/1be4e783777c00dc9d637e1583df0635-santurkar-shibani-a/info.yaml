abstract: 'Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables
  faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness,
  the exact reasons for BatchNorm''s effectiveness are still poorly understood. The
  popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the
  layers'' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate
  shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer
  inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more
  fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization
  landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and
  stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.'
