abstract: We study the computational tractability of PAC reinforcement learning with
  rich observations. We present new provably sample-efficient algorithms for environments
  with deterministic hidden state dynamics and stochastic rich observations. These
  methods operate in an oracle model of computation -- accessing policy and value
  function classes exclusively through standard optimization primitives -- and therefore
  represent computationally efficient alternatives to prior algorithms that require
  enumeration. With stochastic hidden state dynamics, we prove that the only known
  sample-efficient algorithm, OLIVE, cannot be implemented in the oracle model. We
  also present several examples that illustrate fundamental challenges of tractable
  PAC reinforcement learning in such general settings.
