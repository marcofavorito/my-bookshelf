abstract: Hyperledger Fabric is an enterprise grade permissioned distributed ledger
  platform that offers modularity for a broad set of industry use cases. One modular
  component is a pluggable ordering service that establishes consensus on the order
  of transactions and batches them into blocks. However, as of the time of this writing,
  there is no production grade Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) ordering service for
  Fabric, with the latest version (v2.1) supporting only Crash Fault-Tolerance (CFT).
  In our work, we address crucial aspects of BFT integration into Fabric that were
  left unsolved in all prior works, making them unfit for production use. In this
  work we describe the design and implementation of a BFT ordering service for Fabric,
  employing a new BFT consensus library. The new library, based on the BFT-Smart protocol
  and written in Go, is tailored to the blockchain use-case, yet is general enough
  to cater to a wide variety of other uses. We evaluate the new BFT ordering service
  by comparing it with the currently supported Raft-based CFT ordering service in
  Hyperledger Fabric.
