abstract: Modern deep learning methods constitute incredibly powerful tools to tackle
  a myriad of challenging problems. However, since deep learning methods operate as
  black boxes, the uncertainty associated with their predictions is often challenging
  to quantify. Bayesian statistics offer a formalism to understand and quantify the
  uncertainty associated with deep neural network predictions. This tutorial provides
  an overview of the relevant literature and a complete toolset to design, implement,
  train, use and evaluate Bayesian Neural Networks, i.e. Stochastic Artificial Neural
  Networks trained using Bayesian methods.
