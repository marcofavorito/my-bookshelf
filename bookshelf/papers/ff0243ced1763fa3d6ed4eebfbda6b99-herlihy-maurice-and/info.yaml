abstract: 'Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Topology describes techniques
  for analyzing distributed algorithms based on award winning combinatorial topology
  research. The authors present a solid theoretical foundation relevant to many real
  systems reliant on parallelism with unpredictable delays, such as multicore microprocessors,
  wireless networks, distributed systems, and Internet protocols. Today, a new student
  or researcher must assemble a collection of scattered conference publications, which
  are typically terse and commonly use different notations and terminologies. This
  book provides a self-contained explanation of the mathematics to readers with computer
  science backgrounds, as well as explaining computer science concepts to readers
  with backgrounds in applied mathematics. The first section presents mathematical
  notions and models, including message passing and shared-memory systems, failures,
  and timing models. The next section presents core concepts in two chapters each:
  first, proving a simple result that lends itself to examples and pictures that will
  build up readers'' intuition; then generalizing the concept to prove a more sophisticated
  result. The overall result weaves together and develops the basic concepts of the
  field, presenting them in a gradual and intuitively appealing way. The book''s final
  section discusses advanced topics typically found in a graduate-level course for
  those who wish to explore further. Gathers knowledge otherwise spread across research
  and conference papers using consistent notations and a standard approach to facilitate
  understandingPresents unique insights applicable to multiple computing fields, including
  multicore microprocessors, wireless networks, distributed systems, and Internet
  protocols Synthesizes and distills material into a simple, unified presentation
  with examples, illustrations, and exercises'
