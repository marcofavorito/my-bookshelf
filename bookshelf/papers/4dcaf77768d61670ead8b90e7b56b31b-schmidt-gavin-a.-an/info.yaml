abstract: If an industrial civilization had existed on Earth many millions of years
  prior to our own era, what traces would it have left and would they be detectable
  today? We summarize the likely geological fingerprint of the Anthropocene, and demonstrate
  that while clear, it will not differ greatly in many respects from other known events
  in the geological record. We then propose tests that could plausibly distinguish
  an industrial cause from an otherwise naturally occurring climate event.
