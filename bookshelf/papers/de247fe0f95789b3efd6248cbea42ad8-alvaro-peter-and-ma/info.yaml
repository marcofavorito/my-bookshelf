abstract: 'Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a
  distributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed
  systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system
  evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily
  delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse.
  Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key
  constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable
  delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which
  increases the complexity of the language or its interpretation, and forces programmers
  to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous
  languages is a notion of time.


  In this paper we present Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning
  about distributed systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation,
  aggregate functions, successor and choice, and admits an explicit representation
  of time into the logic language. We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation
  for the two signature features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous
  processing and communication. Given these two features, we address three important
  properties of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of safety appropriate
  to non-terminating computations, stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over
  time, and efficient evaluation over time via a simple execution strategy. We also
  provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety and stratification.
  Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests
  that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich distributed services and
  protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness.'
