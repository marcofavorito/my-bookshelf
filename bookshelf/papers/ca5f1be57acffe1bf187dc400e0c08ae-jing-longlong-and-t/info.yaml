abstract: Large-scale labeled data are generally required to train deep neural networks
  in order to obtain better performance in visual feature learning from images or
  videos for computer vision applications. To avoid extensive cost of collecting and
  annotating large-scale datasets, as a subset of unsupervised learning methods, self-supervised
  learning methods are proposed to learn general image and video features from large-scale
  unlabeled data without using any human-annotated labels. This paper provides an
  extensive review of deep learning-based self-supervised general visual feature learning
  methods from images or videos. First, the motivation, general pipeline, and terminologies
  of this field are described. Then the common deep neural network architectures that
  used for self-supervised learning are summarized. Next, the main components and
  evaluation metrics of self-supervised learning methods are reviewed followed by
  the commonly used image and video datasets and the existing self-supervised visual
  feature learning methods. Finally, quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed
  methods on benchmark datasets are summarized and discussed for both image and video
  feature learning. At last, this paper is concluded and lists a set of promising
  future directions for self-supervised visual feature learning.
