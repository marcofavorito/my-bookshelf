abstract: We introduce stochastic variational inference for Gaussian process models.
  This enables the application of Gaussian process (GP) models to data sets containing
  millions of data points. We show how GPs can be vari- ationally decomposed to depend
  on a set of globally relevant inducing variables which factorize the model in the
  necessary manner to perform variational inference. Our ap- proach is readily extended
  to models with non-Gaussian likelihoods and latent variable models based around
  Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the approach on a simple toy problem and two
  real world data sets.
