abstract: We study encodings from CSP into asynchronous CCS with name passing and
  matching, so in fact, the asynchronous pi-calculus. By doing so, we discuss two
  different ways to map the multi-way synchronisation mechanism of CSP into the two-way
  synchronisation mechanism of CCS. Both encodings satisfy the criteria of Gorla except
  for compositionality, as both use an additional top-level context. Following the
  work of Parrow and Sj\"odin, the first encoding uses a centralised coordinator and
  establishes a variant of weak bisimilarity between source terms and their translations.
  The second encoding is decentralised, and thus more efficient, but ensures only
  a form of coupled similarity between source terms and their translations.
