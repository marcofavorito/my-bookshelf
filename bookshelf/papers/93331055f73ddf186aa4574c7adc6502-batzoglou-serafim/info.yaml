abstract: I present the proof of Goedel's First Incompleteness theorem in an intuitive
  manner, while covering all technically challenging steps. I present generalizations
  of Goedel's fixed point lemma to two-sentence and multi-sentence versions, which
  allow proof of incompleteness through circular versions of the liar's paradox. I
  discuss the relation of Goedel's First and Second Incompletneness theorems to Goedel's
  Completeness theorems, and conclude with remarks on implications of these results
  for mathematics, computation, theory of mind and AI.
