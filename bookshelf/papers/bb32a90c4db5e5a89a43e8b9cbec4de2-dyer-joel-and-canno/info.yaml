abstract: 'Simulation models, in particular agent-based models, are gaining popularity
  in economics. The considerable flexibility they offer, as well as their capacity
  to reproduce a variety of empirically observed behaviours of complex systems, give
  them broad appeal, and the increasing availability of cheap computing power has
  made their use feasible. Yet a widespread adoption in real-world modelling and decision-making
  scenarios has been hindered by the difficulty of performing parameter estimation
  for such models. In general, simulation models lack a tractable likelihood function,
  which precludes a straightforward application of standard statistical inference
  techniques. Several recent works have sought to address this problem through the
  application of likelihood-free inference techniques, in which parameter estimates
  are determined by performing some form of comparison between the observed data and
  simulation output. However, these approaches are (a) founded on restrictive assumptions,
  and/or (b) typically require many hundreds of thousands of simulations. These qualities
  make them unsuitable for large-scale simulations in economics and can cast doubt
  on the validity of these inference methods in such scenarios. In this paper, we
  investigate the efficacy of two classes of black-box approximate Bayesian inference
  methods that have recently drawn significant attention within the probabilistic
  machine learning community: neural posterior estimation and neural density ratio
  estimation. We present benchmarking experiments in which we demonstrate that neural
  network based black-box methods provide state of the art parameter inference for
  economic simulation models, and crucially are compatible with generic multivariate
  time-series data. In addition, we suggest appropriate assessment criteria for future
  benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures for economic simulation
  models.'
