abstract: Models that can simulate how environments change in response to actions
  can be used by agents to plan and act efficiently. We improve on previous environment
  simulators from high-dimensional pixel observations by introducing recurrent neural
  networks that are able to make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for
  hundreds of time-steps into the future. We present an in-depth analysis of the factors
  affecting performance, providing the most extensive attempt to advance the understanding
  of the properties of these models. We address the issue of computationally inefficiency
  with a model that does not need to generate a high-dimensional image at each time-step.
  We show that our approach can be used to improve exploration and is adaptable to
  many diverse environments, namely 10 Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and
  complex 3D mazes.
