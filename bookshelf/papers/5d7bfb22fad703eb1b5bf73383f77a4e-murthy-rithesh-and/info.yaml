abstract: In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach for Rapid Exploration and
  eXploitation for AI Agents called REX. Existing AutoGPT-style techniques have inherent
  limitations, such as a heavy reliance on precise descriptions for decision-making,
  and the lack of a systematic approach to leverage try-and-fail procedures akin to
  traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL). REX introduces an additional layer of rewards
  and integrates concepts similar to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) scores, leading
  to more robust and efficient AI agent performance. This approach has the advantage
  of enabling the utilization of offline behaviors from logs and allowing seamless
  integration with existing foundation models while it does not require any model
  fine-tuning. Through comparative analysis with existing methods such as Chain-of-Thoughts(CoT)
  and Reasoning viA Planning(RAP), REX-based methods demonstrate comparable performance
  and, in certain cases, even surpass the results achieved by these existing techniques.
  Notably, REX-based methods exhibit remarkable reductions in execution time, enhancing
  their practical applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.
