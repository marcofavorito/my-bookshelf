abstract: <jats:p>In this paper, we give a simple and efficient implementation of
  reverse-mode automatic differentiation, which both extends easily to higher-order
  functions, and has run time and memory consumption linear in the run time of the
  original program. In addition to a formal description of the translation, we also
  describe an implementation of this algorithm, and prove its correctness by means
  of a logical relations argument.</jats:p>
