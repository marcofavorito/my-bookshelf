abstract: "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Will new technologies\
  \ cause industries to shed jobs, requiring novel policies to address mass unemployment?\
  \ Sometimes productivity-enhancing technology increases industry employment instead.\
  \ In manufacturing, jobs grew along with productivity for a century or more; only\
  \ later did productivity gains bring declining employment. What changed? The elasticity\
  \ of demand. Using data over two centuries for US textile, steel and auto industries,\
  \ this paper shows that automation initially spurred job growth because demand was\
  \ highly elastic. But demand later became satiated, leading to job losses. A simple\
  \ model explains why this pattern might be common, suggesting that today’s technologies\
  \ may cause some industries to decline and others to grow. Automation might not\
  \ cause mass unemployment, but it may well require workers to make disruptive transitions\
  \ to new industries, requiring new skills and occupations.</jats:p>"
