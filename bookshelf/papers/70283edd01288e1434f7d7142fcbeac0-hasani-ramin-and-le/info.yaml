abstract: We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
  Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities, we
  construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via nonlinear
  interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems with varying
  (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being
  computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit
  stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural
  ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series
  prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach
  to find bounds over their dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory
  length measure in latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series
  prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant
  Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs. Code and data are available
