abstract: Input validation is the first line of defense against malformed or malicious
  inputs. It is therefore critical that the validator (which is often part of the
  parser) is free of bugs.   To build dependable input validators, we propose using
  parser generators for context-free languages. In the context of network protocols,
  various works have pointed at context-free languages as falling short to specify
  precisely or concisely common idioms found in protocols. We review those assessments
  and perform a rigorous, language-theoretic analysis of several common protocol idioms.
  We then demonstrate the practical value of our findings by developing a modular,
  robust, and efficient input validator for HTTP relying on context-free grammars
  and regular expressions.
