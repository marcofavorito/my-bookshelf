abstract: The limitation with smart contracts is that they cannot access external
  data which might be required to control the execution of business logic. Oracles
  can be used to provide external data to smart contracts. An oracle is an interface
  that delivers data from external data outside the blockchain to a smart contract
  to consume. Oracle can deliver different types of data depending on the industry
  and requirements. In this paper, we study and describe the widely used blockchain
  oracles. Then, we elaborate on his potential role, technical architecture, and design
  patterns. Finally, we discuss the human oracle and his key role in solving the truth
  problem by reaching a consensus about a certain inquiry and tasks.
