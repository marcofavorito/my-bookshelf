abstract: 'Building a scalable and real-time recommendation system is vital for many
  businesses driven by time-sensitive customer feedback, such as short-videos ranking
  or online ads. Despite the ubiquitous adoption of production-scale deep learning
  frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these general-purpose frameworks fall short
  of business demands in recommendation scenarios for various reasons: on one hand,
  tweaking systems based on static parameters and dense computations for recommendation
  with dynamic and sparse features is detrimental to model quality; on the other hand,
  such frameworks are designed with batch-training stage and serving stage completely
  separated, preventing the model from interacting with customer feedback in real-time.
  These issues led us to reexamine traditional approaches and explore radically different
  design choices. In this paper, we present Monolith, a system tailored for online
  training. Our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads
  and production environment that reflects a marked departure from other recommendations
  systems. Our contributions are manifold: first, we crafted a collisionless embedding
  table with optimizations such as expirable embeddings and frequency filtering to
  reduce its memory footprint; second, we provide an production-ready online training
  architecture with high fault-tolerance; finally, we proved that system reliability
  could be traded-off for real-time learning. Monolith has successfully landed in
  the BytePlus Recommend product.'
