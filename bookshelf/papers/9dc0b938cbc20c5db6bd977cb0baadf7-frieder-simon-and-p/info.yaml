abstract: 'We investigate the mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT by testing it on
  publicly available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, and measuring its performance
  against other models trained on a mathematical corpus, such as Minerva. We also
  test whether ChatGPT can be a useful assistant to professional mathematicians by
  emulating various use cases that come up in the daily professional activities of
  mathematicians (question answering, theorem searching). In contrast to formal mathematics,
  where large databases of formal proofs are available (e.g., the Lean Mathematical
  Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics, used to benchmark language
  models, only cover elementary mathematics. We address this issue by introducing
  a new dataset: GHOSTS. It is the first natural-language dataset made and curated
  by working researchers in mathematics that (1) aims to cover graduate-level mathematics
  and (2) provides a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of language
  models. We benchmark ChatGPT on GHOSTS and evaluate performance against fine-grained
  criteria. We make this new dataset publicly available to assist a community-driven
  comparison of ChatGPT with (future) large language models in terms of advanced mathematical
  comprehension. We conclude that contrary to many positive reports in the media (a
  potential case of selection bias), ChatGPT''s mathematical abilities are significantly
  below those of an average mathematics graduate student. Our results show that ChatGPT
  often understands the question but fails to provide correct solutions. Hence, if
  your goal is to use it to pass a university exam, you would be better off copying
  from your average peer!'
