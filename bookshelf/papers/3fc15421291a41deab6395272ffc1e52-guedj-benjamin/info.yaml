abstract: Generalised Bayesian learning algorithms are increasingly popular in machine
  learning, due to their PAC generalisation properties and flexibility. The present
  paper aims at providing a self-contained survey on the resulting PAC-Bayes framework
  and some of its main theoretical and algorithmic developments.
