abstract: 'We imagine agent planning programs as programs built from achievement and
  maintenance goals. Their executions require the ability to meet such goals while
  respecting the programs'' control flow. The question then is: can we always guarantee
  the execution of such programs? In this paper, we define this novel planning-programming
  problem formally, and propose a sound, complete and optimal wrt computational complexity
  technique to actually generate a solution by appealing to recent results in LTL-based
  synthesis of reactive systems.'
