abstract: Cooperation in multi-agent learning (MAL) is a topic at the intersection
  of numerous disciplines, including game theory, economics, social sciences, and
  evolutionary biology. Research in this area aims to understand both how agents can
  coordinate effectively when goals are aligned and how they may cooperate in settings
  where gains from working together are possible but possibilities for conflict abound.
  In this paper we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts, problem settings
  and algorithms of multi-agent learning. This encompasses reinforcement learning,
  multi-agent sequential decision-making, challenges associated with multi-agent cooperation,
  and a comprehensive review of recent progress, along with an evaluation of relevant
  metrics. Finally we discuss open challenges in the field with the aim of inspiring
  new avenues for research.
