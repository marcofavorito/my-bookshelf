abstract: 'Register automata are finite automata equipped with a finite set of registers
  in which they can store data, i.e. elements from an unbounded or infinite alphabet.
  They provide a simple formalism to specify the behaviour of reactive systems operating
  over data {\omega}-words. We study the synthesis problem for specifications given
  as register automata over a linearly ordered data domain (e.g. (N, {\leq}) or (Q,
  {\leq})), which allow for comparison of data with regards to the linear order. To
  that end, we extend the classical Church synthesis game to infinite alphabets: two
  players, Adam and Eve, alternately play some data, and Eve wins whenever their interaction
  complies with the specification, which is a language of {\omega}-words over ordered
  data. Such games are however undecidable, even when the specification is recognised
  by a deterministic register automaton. This is in contrast with the equality case,
  where the problem is only undecidable for nondeterministic and universal specifications.
  Thus, we study one-sided Church games, where Eve instead operates over a finite
  alphabet, while Adam still manipulates data. We show they are determined, and deciding
  the existence of a winning strategy is in ExpTime, both for Q and N. This follows
  from a study of constraint sequences, which abstract the behaviour of register automata,
  and allow us to reduce Church games to {\omega}-regular games. Lastly, we apply
  these results to the transducer synthesis problem for input-driven register automata,
  where each output data is restricted to be the content of some register, and show
  that if there exists an implementation, then there exists one which is a register
  transducer.'
