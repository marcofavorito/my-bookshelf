abstract: The goal of privacy metrics is to measure the degree of privacy enjoyed
  by users in a system and the amount of protection offered by privacy-enhancing technologies.
  In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital
  world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature makes an
  informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, instead of using existing metrics,
  new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable.
  In this survey we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy
  metrics. To this end, we explain and discuss a selection of over eighty privacy
  metrics and introduce categorizations based on the aspect of privacy they measure,
  their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition,
  we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on nine questions that
  help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics
  where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy
  domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.
