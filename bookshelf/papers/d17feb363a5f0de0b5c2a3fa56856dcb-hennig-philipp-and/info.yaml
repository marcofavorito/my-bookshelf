abstract: 'We deliver a call to arms for probabilistic numerical methods: algorithms
  for numerical tasks, including linear algebra, integration, optimization and solving
  differential equations, that return uncertainties in their calculations. Such uncertainties,
  arising from the loss of precision induced by numerical calculation with limited
  time or hardware, are important for much contemporary science and industry. Within
  applications such as climate science and astrophysics, the need to make decisions
  on the basis of computations with large and complex data has led to a renewed focus
  on the management of numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic
  numerical methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then
  show that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be adapted
  to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical performance.
  We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic numeric algorithms
  on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical imaging, while highlighting
  open problems with these new algorithms. Finally, we describe how probabilistic
  numerical methods provide a coherent framework for identifying the uncertainty in
  calculations performed with a combination of numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical
  optimisers and differential equation solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis
  (and control) of error sources in computations.'
