abstract: Foundation models pretrained on diverse data at scale have demonstrated
  extraordinary capabilities in a wide range of vision and language tasks. When such
  models are deployed in real world environments, they inevitably interface with other
  entities and agents. For example, language models are often used to interact with
  human beings through dialogue, and visual perception models are used to autonomously
  navigate neighborhood streets. In response to these developments, new paradigms
  are emerging for training foundation models to interact with other agents and perform
  long-term reasoning. These paradigms leverage the existence of ever-larger datasets
  curated for multimodal, multitask, and generalist interaction. Research at the intersection
  of foundation models and decision making holds tremendous promise for creating powerful
  new systems that can interact effectively across a diverse range of applications
  such as dialogue, autonomous driving, healthcare, education, and robotics. In this
  manuscript, we examine the scope of foundation models for decision making, and provide
  conceptual tools and technical background for understanding the problem space and
  exploring new research directions. We review recent approaches that ground foundation
  models in practical decision making applications through a variety of methods such
  as prompting, conditional generative modeling, planning, optimal control, and reinforcement
  learning, and discuss common challenges and open problems in the field.
