abstract: The central open question in Descriptive Complexity is whether there is
  a logic that characterizes deterministic polynomial time (PTIME) on relational structures.
  Towards this goal, we define a logic that is obtained from first-order logic with
  fixed points, FO(FP), by a series of transformations that include restricting logical
  connectives and adding a dynamic version of Hilbert's Choice operator Epsilon. The
  formalism can be viewed, simultaneously, as an algebra of binary relations and as
  a linear-time modal dynamic logic, where algebraic expressions describing ``proofs''
  or ``programs'' appear inside the modalities. We show how counting, reachability
  and ``mixed'' examples (that include linear equations modulo two) are axiomatized
  in the logic, and how an arbitrary PTIME Turing machine can be encoded. For each
  fixed Choice function, the data complexity of model checking is in PTIME. However,
  there can be exponentially many such functions. A crucial question is under what
  syntactic conditions on algebraic terms checking just one Choice function is sufficient.
  Answering this question requires a study of symmetries among computations. This
  paper sets mathematical foundations towards such a study via algebraic and automata-theoretic
  techniques.
