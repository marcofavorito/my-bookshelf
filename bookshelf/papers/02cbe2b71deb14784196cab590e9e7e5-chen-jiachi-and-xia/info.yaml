abstract: The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy
  a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers.
  On the one hand, using selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart
  contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen,
  e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity
  for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand
  the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their
  contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize
  the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy
  an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According
  to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also
  called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by
  computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor
  contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death
  of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission)
  might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to
  detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting
  Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89%
  of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers
  who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use
  selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.
