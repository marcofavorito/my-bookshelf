abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients
  (e.g. mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under
  the orchestration of a central server (e.g. service provider), while keeping the
  training data decentralized. FL embodies the principles of focused data collection
  and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks and costs
  resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches.
  Motivated by the explosive growth in FL research, this paper discusses recent advances
  and presents an extensive collection of open problems and challenges.
