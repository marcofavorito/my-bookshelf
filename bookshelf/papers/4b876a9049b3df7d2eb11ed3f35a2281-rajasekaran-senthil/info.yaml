abstract: The problems of \emph{verification} and \emph{realizability} are two central
  themes in the analysis of reactive systems. When multiagent systems are considered,
  these problems have natural analogues of existence (nonemptiness) of pure-strategy
  Nash equilibria and verification of pure-strategy Nash equilibria. Recently, this
  body of work has begun to include finite-horizon temporal goals. With finite-horizon
  temporal goals, there is a natural hierarchy of goal representation, ranging from
  deterministic finite automata (DFA), to nondeterministic finite automata (NFA),
  and to alternating finite automata (AFA), with a worst-case exponential gap between
  each successive representation. Previous works showed that the realizability problem
  with DFA goals was PSPACE-complete, while the realizability problem with temporal
  logic goals is in 2EXPTIME. In this work, we study both the realizability and the
  verification problems with respect to various goal representations. We first show
  that the realizability problem with NFA goals is EXPTIME-complete and with AFA goals
  is 2EXPTIME-complete, thus establishing strict complexity gaps between realizability
  with respect to DFA, NFA, and AFA goals. We then contrast these complexity gaps
  with the complexity of the verification problem, where we show that verification
  with respect to DFAs, NFA, and AFA goals is PSPACE-complete.
