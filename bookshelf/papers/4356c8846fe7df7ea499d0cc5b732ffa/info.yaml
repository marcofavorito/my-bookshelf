abstract: Unless you are working on a problem where you can afford a true Random Number
  Generator (RNG), which is basically never for most of us, implementing something
  random means relying on a pseudo Random Number Generator. I want to share here what
  I have learnt about good practices with pseudo RNGs and especially the ones available
  in numpy.
