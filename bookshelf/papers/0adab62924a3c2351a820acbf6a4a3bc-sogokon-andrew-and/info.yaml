abstract: Specifying the intended behaviour of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly
  important but is fraught with many challenges. This technical report provides an
  overview of existing work on specifications of autonomous systems and places a particular
  emphasis on formal specification, i.e. mathematically rigorous approaches to specification
  that require an appropriate formalism. Given the breadth of this domain, our coverage
  is necessarily incomplete but serves to provide a brief introduction to some of
  the difficulties that specifying autonomous systems entails, as well as existing
  approaches to addressing these difficulties currently pursued in academia and industry.
