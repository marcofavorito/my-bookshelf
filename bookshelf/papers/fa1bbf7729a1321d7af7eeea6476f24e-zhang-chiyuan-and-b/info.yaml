abstract: Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can
  exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional
  wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family,
  or to the regularization techniques used during training.   Through extensive systematic
  experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large
  neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish
  that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with
  stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This
  phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even
  if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate
  these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple
  depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon
  as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does
  in practice.   We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional
  models.
