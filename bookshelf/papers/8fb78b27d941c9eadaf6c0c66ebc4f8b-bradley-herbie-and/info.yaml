abstract: In many text-generation problems, users may prefer not only a single response,
  but a diverse range of high-quality outputs from which to choose. Quality-diversity
  (QD) search algorithms aim at such outcomes, by continually improving and diversifying
  a population of candidates. However, the applicability of QD to qualitative domains,
  like creative writing, has been limited by the difficulty of algorithmically specifying
  measures of quality and diversity. Interestingly, recent developments in language
  models (LMs) have enabled guiding search through AI feedback, wherein LMs are prompted
  in natural language to evaluate qualitative aspects of text. Leveraging this development,
  we introduce Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF), wherein an evolutionary
  algorithm applies LMs to both generate variation and evaluate the quality and diversity
  of candidate text. When assessed on creative writing domains, QDAIF covers more
  of a specified search space with high-quality samples than do non-QD controls. Further,
  human evaluation of QDAIF-generated creative texts validates reasonable agreement
  between AI and human evaluation. Our results thus highlight the potential of AI
  feedback to guide open-ended search for creative and original solutions, providing
  a recipe that seemingly generalizes to many domains and modalities. In this way,
  QDAIF is a step towards AI systems that can independently search, diversify, evaluate,
  and improve, which are among the core skills underlying human society's capacity
  for innovation.
