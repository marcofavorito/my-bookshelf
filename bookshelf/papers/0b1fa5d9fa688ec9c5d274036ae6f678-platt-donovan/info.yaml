abstract: Interest in agent-based models of financial markets and the wider economy
  has increased consistently over the last few decades, in no small part due to their
  ability to reproduce a number of empirically-observed stylised facts that are not
  easily recovered by more traditional modelling approaches. Nevertheless, the agent-based
  modelling paradigm faces mounting criticism, focused particularly on the rigour
  of current validation and calibration practices, most of which remain qualitative
  and stylised fact-driven. While the literature on quantitative and data-driven approaches
  has seen significant expansion in recent years, most studies have focused on the
  introduction of new calibration methods that are neither benchmarked against existing
  alternatives nor rigorously tested in terms of the quality of the estimates they
  produce. We therefore compare a number of prominent ABM calibration methods, both
  established and novel, through a series of computational experiments in an attempt
  to determine the respective strengths and weaknesses of each approach and the overall
  quality of the resultant parameter estimates. We find that Bayesian estimation,
  though less popular in the literature, consistently outperforms frequentist, objective
  function-based approaches and results in reasonable parameter estimates in many
  contexts. Despite this, we also find that agent-based model calibration techniques
  require further development in order to definitively calibrate large-scale models.
  We therefore make suggestions for future research.
