abstract: 'In this paper we present ISA, an approach for learning and exploiting subgoals
  in episodic reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. ISA interleaves reinforcement learning
  with the induction of a subgoal automaton, an automaton whose edges are labeled
  by the task''s subgoals expressed as propositional logic formulas over a set of
  high-level events. A subgoal automaton also consists of two special states: a state
  indicating the successful completion of the task, and a state indicating that the
  task has finished without succeeding. A state-of-the-art inductive logic programming
  system is used to learn a subgoal automaton that covers the traces of high-level
  events observed by the RL agent. When the currently exploited automaton does not
  correctly recognize a trace, the automaton learner induces a new automaton that
  covers that trace. The interleaving process guarantees the induction of automata
  with the minimum number of states, and applies a symmetry breaking mechanism to
  shrink the search space whilst remaining complete. We evaluate ISA in several grid-world
  and continuous state space problems using different RL algorithms that leverage
  the automaton structures. We provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the automaton
  learning process performance in terms of the traces, the symmetric breaking and
  specific restrictions imposed on the final learnable automaton. For each class of
  RL problem, we show that the learned automata can be successfully exploited to learn
  policies that reach the goal, achieving an average reward comparable to the case
  where automata are not learned but handcrafted and given beforehand.'
