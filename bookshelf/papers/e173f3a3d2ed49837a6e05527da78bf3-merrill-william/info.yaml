abstract: This work attempts to explain the types of computation that neural networks
  can perform by relating them to automata. We first define what it means for a real-time
  network with bounded precision to accept a language. A measure of network memory
  follows from this definition. We then characterize the classes of languages acceptable
  by various recurrent networks, attention, and convolutional networks. We find that
  LSTMs function like counter machines and relate convolutional networks to the subregular
  hierarchy. Overall, this work attempts to increase our understanding and ability
  to interpret neural networks through the lens of theory. These theoretical insights
  help explain neural computation, as well as the relationship between neural networks
  and natural language grammar.
