abstract: Relational joins are at the core of relational algebra, which in turn is
  the core of the standard database query language SQL. As their evaluation is expensive
  and very often dominated by the output size, it is an important task for database
  query optimisers to compute estimates on the size of joins and to find good execution
  plans for sequences of joins. We study these problems from a theoretical perspective,
  both in the worst-case model, and in an average-case model where the database is
  chosen according to a known probability distribution. In the former case, our first
  key observation is that the worst-case size of a query is characterised by the fractional
  edge cover number of its underlying hypergraph, a combinatorial parameter previously
  known to provide an upper bound. We complete the picture by proving a matching lower
  bound, and by showing that there exist queries for which the join-project plan suggested
  by the fractional edge cover approach may be substantially better than any join
  plan that does not use intermediate projections. On the other hand, we show that
  in the average-case model, every join-project plan can be turned into a plan containing
  no projections in such a way that the expected time to evaluate the plan increases
  only by a constant factor independent of the size of the database. Not surprisingly,
  the key combinatorial parameter in this context is the maximum density of the underlying
  hypergraph. We show how to make effective use of this parameter to eliminate the
  projections.
