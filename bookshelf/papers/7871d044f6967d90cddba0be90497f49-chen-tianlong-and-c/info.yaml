abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging approach that leverages machine
  learning to develop optimization methods, aiming at reducing the laborious iterations
  of hand engineering. It automates the design of an optimization method based on
  its performance on a set of training problems. This data-driven procedure generates
  methods that can efficiently solve problems similar to those in the training. In
  sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs of optimization methods are
  theory-driven, so they obtain performance guarantees over the classes of problems
  specified by the theory. The difference makes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving
  a certain type of optimization problems over a specific distribution of data, while
  it typically fails on out-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends
  on the type of target optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn,
  and the training procedure. This new paradigm has motivated a community of researchers
  to explore L2O and report their findings.   This article is poised to be the first
  comprehensive survey and benchmark of L2O for continuous optimization. We set up
  taxonomies, categorize existing works and research directions, present insights,
  and identify open challenges. We also benchmarked many existing L2O approaches on
  a few but representative optimization problems. For reproducible research and fair
  benchmarking purposes, we released our software implementation and data in the package
  Open-L2O at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Open-L2O.
