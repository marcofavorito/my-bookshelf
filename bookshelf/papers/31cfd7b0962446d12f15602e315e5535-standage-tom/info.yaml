abstract: The world can be an amazing place if you know the right questions to ask:How
  did carrots become orange? What's stopping us from having a four-day week? How can
  we remove all the broken bits of satellite from orbit? If everything is so terrible,
  why is the global suicide rate falling?The keen minds of the Economist love to look
  beyond everyday appearances to find out what really makes things tick. In this latest
  collection of The Economist Explains, they have gathered together the juiciest fruits
  of their never-ending quest for answers. For an uncommonly interesting read, take
  a peek at some Uncommon Knowledge - and pass it on! The world only gets more amazing
  when discoveries are shared.
