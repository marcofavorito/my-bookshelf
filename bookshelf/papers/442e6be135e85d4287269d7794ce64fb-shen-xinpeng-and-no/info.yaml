abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Causal Structure Discovery (CSD)
  is the problem of identifying causal relationships from large quantities of data
  through computational methods. With the limited ability of traditional association-based
  computational methods to discover causal relationships, CSD methodologies are gaining
  popularity. The goal of the study was to systematically examine whether (i) CSD
  methods can discover the known causal relationships from observational clinical
  data and (ii) to offer guidance to accurately discover known causal relationships.
  We used Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because
  the well-established evidence provides a “gold-standard” causal graph for evaluation.
  We evaluated two CSD methods, Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Fast Greedy Equivalence
  Search (FGES) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by
  the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used structural equation
  models (which is not designed for CSD) as control. We applied these methods under
  three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to
  the methods. The methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships
  with the “gold standard” graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated CSD
  methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard.
  For best results, CSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing
  as much prior knowledge as possible.</jats:p>
