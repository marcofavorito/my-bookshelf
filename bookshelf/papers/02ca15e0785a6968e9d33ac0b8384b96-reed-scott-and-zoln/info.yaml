abstract: Inspired by progress in large-scale language modeling, we apply a similar
  approach towards building a single generalist agent beyond the realm of text outputs.
  The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment
  generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption
  images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on
  its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens.
  In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities
  of Gato.
