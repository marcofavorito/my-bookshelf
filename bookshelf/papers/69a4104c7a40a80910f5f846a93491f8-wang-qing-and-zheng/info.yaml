abstract: Consensus is unnecessary when the truth is available. In this paper, we
  present a new perspective of rebuilding the blockchain without consensus. When the
  consensus phase is eliminated from a blockchain, transactions could be canonized
  quickly using a well-defined universal rule without consuming hashing power. Thus,
  the transactions per second(TPS) metric of such the consensusless blockchain can
  be largely boosted. Although consensus blockchain is promising, several technical
  challenges are also crucial. For example, double-spending attacks and frequent forking
  events must be prevented, the credit of block's minting must be carefully defined,
  and etc. To address those technical challenges, we propose several solutions for
  our consensusless blockchain (CB), including a naive monotonic scoring mechanism
  to calculate the ranking of each block in the chain, and a two-stage witness mechanism
  to add new blocks. The proposed CB chain is promising to offer a simplified and
  equipment-cheap infrastructure for rich real-world decentralized applications.
