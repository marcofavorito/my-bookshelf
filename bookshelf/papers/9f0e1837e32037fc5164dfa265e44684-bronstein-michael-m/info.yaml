abstract: Many scientific fields study data with an underlying structure that is a
  non-Euclidean space. Some examples include social networks in computational social
  sciences, sensor networks in communications, functional networks in brain imaging,
  regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many
  applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks,
  on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques.
  In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven
  to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural
  language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful
  on data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where
  the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them.
  Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to
  generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs
  and manifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric
  deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications,
  and future research directions in this nascent field.
