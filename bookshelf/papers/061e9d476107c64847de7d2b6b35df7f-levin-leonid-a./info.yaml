abstract: Goedel Incompleteness Theorem leaves open a way around it, vaguely perceived
  for a long time but not clearly identified. (Thus, Goedel believed informal arguments
  can answer any math question.) Closing this loophole does not seem obvious and involves
  Kolmogorov complexity. (This is unrelated to, well studied before, complexity quantifications
  of the usual Goedel effects.) I consider extensions U of the universal partial recursive
  predicate (or, say, Peano Arithmetic). I prove that any U either leaves an n-bit
  input (statement) unresolved or contains nearly all information about the n-bit
  prefix of any r.e. real r (which is n bits for some r). I argue that creating significant
  information about a SPECIFIC math sequence is impossible regardless of the methods
  used. Similar problems and answers apply to other unsolvability results for tasks
  allowing multiple solutions, e.g. non-recursive tilings.
