abstract: 'This paper describes the design, implementation, and successful use of
  the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a novel minimal simulation of a centralised financial
  market, based on a Limit Order Book (LOB) such as is common in major stock exchanges.
  Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world''s major financial
  markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility
  of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading
  systems. Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial
  market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world exchange is ever likely
  to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live,
  forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data. Similarly,
  university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated
  trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a sufficiently
  realistic teaching environment. BSE as described here addresses both those needs:
  it has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university
  since 2012, and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHuB.'
