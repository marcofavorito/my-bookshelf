abstract: Many interesting and useful symbolic computation algorithms manipulate mathematical
  expressions in mathematically meaningful ways. Although these algorithms are commonplace
  in computer algebra systems, they can be surprisingly difficult to specify in a
  formal logic since they involve an interplay of syntax and semantics. In this paper
  we discuss several examples of syntax-based mathematical algorithms, and we show
  how to specify them in a formal logic with undefinedness, quotation, and evaluation.
