abstract: We study expression learning problems with syntactic restrictions and introduce
  the class of \emph{finite-aspect checkable languages} to characterize symbolic languages
  that admit decidable learning. The semantics of such languages can be defined using
  a bounded amount of auxiliary information, which we call \emph{semantic aspects},
  that is independent of expression size but depends on a fixed structure over which
  evaluation occurs. We introduce a generic programming language for expressing model-checking
  programs that work over expression syntax trees, and we give a meta-theorem that
  connects such programs for finite-aspect checkable languages to finite tree automata,
  which allows us to derive new decidable learning results and decision procedures
  for several expression learning problems by writing model-checking programs in the
  programming language.
