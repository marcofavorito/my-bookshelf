abstract: We present a general framework for applying machine-learning algorithms
  to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of these
  techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the
  state space. Our framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core
  property for verification, and is illustrated through two distinct instantiations.
  The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, and performs a heuristic-driven
  partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the
  required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP,
  and yields probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper
  bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. The latter
  is the first extension of statistical model-checking for unbounded properties in
  MDPs. In contrast with other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention
  to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular
  properties of the MDP. We also show how our techniques extend to LTL objectives.
  We present experimental results showing the performance of our framework on several
  examples.
