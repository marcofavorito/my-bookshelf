abstract: <jats:p>We review PLTLf and PLDLf, the pure-past versions of the well-known
  logics on finite traces LTLf and LDLf, respectively. PLTLf and PLDLf are logics
  about the past, and so scan the trace backwards from the end towards the beginning.
  Because of this, we can exploit a foundational result on reverse languages to get
  an exponential improvement, over LTLf /LDLf , for computing the corresponding DFA.
  This exponential improvement is reflected in several forms of sequential decision
  making involving temporal specifications, such as planning and decision problems
  in non-deterministic and non-Markovian domains. Interestingly, PLTLf (resp., PLDLf
  ) has the same expressive power as LTLf (resp., LDLf ), but transforming a PLTLf
  (resp., PLDLf ) formula into its equivalent LTLf (resp.,LDLf) is quite expensive.
  Hence, to take advantage of the exponential improvement, properties of interest
  must be directly expressed in PLTLf /PLDLf .</jats:p>
