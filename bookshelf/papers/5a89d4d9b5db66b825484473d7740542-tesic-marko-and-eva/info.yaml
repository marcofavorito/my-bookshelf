abstract: We provide a novel Bayesian justification of inference to the best explanation
  (IBE). More specifically, we present conditions under which explanatory considerations
  can provide a significant confirmatory boost for hypotheses that provide the best
  explanation of the relevant evidence. Furthermore, we show that the proposed Bayesian
  model of IBE is able to deal naturally with the best known criticisms of IBE such
  as van Fraassen?s ?bad lot? argument.
