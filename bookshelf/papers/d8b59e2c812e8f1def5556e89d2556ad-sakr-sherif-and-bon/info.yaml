abstract: Graphs are by nature unifying abstractions that can leverage interconnectedness
  to represent, explore, predict, and explain real- and digital-world phenomena. Although
  real users and consumers of graph instances and graph workloads understand these
  abstractions, future problems will require new abstractions and systems. What needs
  to happen in the next decade for big graph processing to continue to succeed?
