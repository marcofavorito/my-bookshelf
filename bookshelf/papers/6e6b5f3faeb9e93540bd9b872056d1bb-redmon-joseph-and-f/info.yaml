abstract: We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system
  that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements
  to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved
  model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and
  COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP,
  outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while
  still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train
  on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously
  on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint
  training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have
  labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task.
  YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having
  detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000
  gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections
  for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.
