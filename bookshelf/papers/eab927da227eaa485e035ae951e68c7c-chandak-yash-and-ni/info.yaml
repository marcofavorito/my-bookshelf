abstract: When faced with sequential decision-making problems, it is often useful
  to be able to predict what would happen if decisions were made using a new policy.
  Those predictions must often be based on data collected under some previously used
  decision-making rule. Many previous methods enable such off-policy (or counterfactual)
  estimation of the expected value of a performance measure called the return. In
  this paper, we take the first steps towards a universal off-policy estimator (UnO)
  -- one that provides off-policy estimates and high-confidence bounds for any parameter
  of the return distribution. We use UnO for estimating and simultaneously bounding
  the mean, variance, quantiles/median, inter-quantile range, CVaR, and the entire
  cumulative distribution of returns. Finally, we also discuss Uno's applicability
  in various settings, including fully observable, partially observable (i.e., with
  unobserved confounders), Markovian, non-Markovian, stationary, smoothly non-stationary,
  and discrete distribution shifts.
