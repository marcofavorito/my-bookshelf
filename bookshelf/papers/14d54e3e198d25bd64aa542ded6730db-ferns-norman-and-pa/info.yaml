abstract: We present metrics for measuring the similarity of states in a finite Markov
  decision process (MDP). The formulation of our metrics is based on the notion of
  bisimulation for MDPs, with an aim towards solving discounted infinite horizon reinforcement
  learning tasks. Such metrics can be used to aggregate states, as well as to better
  structure other value function approximators (e.g., memory-based or nearest-neighbor
  approximators). We provide bounds that relate our metric distances to the optimal
  values of states in the given MDP.
