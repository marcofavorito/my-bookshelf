abstract: Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al.
  is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local
  structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize
  fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce
  a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning
  of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able
  to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation
  that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly
  decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel
  set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments
  show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features
  efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art
  have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.
