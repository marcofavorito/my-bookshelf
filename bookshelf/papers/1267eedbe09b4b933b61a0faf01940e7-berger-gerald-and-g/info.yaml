abstract: 'Vadalog is a system for performing complex reasoning tasks such as those
  required in advanced knowledge graphs. The logical core of the underlying Vadalog
  language is the warded fragment of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs). This formalism
  ensures tractable reasoning in data complexity, while a recent analysis focusing
  on a practical implementation led to the reasoning algorithm around which the Vadalog
  system is built. A fundamental question that has emerged in the context of Vadalog
  is the following: can we limit the recursion allowed by wardedness in order to obtain
  a formalism that provides a convenient syntax for expressing useful recursive statements,
  and at the same time achieves space-efficiency? After analyzing several real-life
  examples of warded sets of TGDs provided by our industrial partners, as well as
  recent benchmarks, we observed that recursion is often used in a restricted way:
  the body of a TGD contains at most one atom whose predicate is mutually recursive
  with a predicate in the head. We show that this type of recursion, known as piece-wise
  linear in the Datalog literature, is the answer to our main question. We further
  show that piece-wise linear recursion alone, without the wardedness condition, is
  not enough as it leads to the undecidability of reasoning. We finally study the
  relative expressiveness of the query languages based on (piece-wise linear) warded
  sets of TGDs.'
