abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to
  their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively
  slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention
  as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity
  property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2\right)$
  to $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this
  formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive
  transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear
  transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up
  to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.
