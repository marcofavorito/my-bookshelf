abstract: 'Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time
  and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate
  attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality
  to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We
  argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting
  for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an
  IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory
  reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze
  the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses
  than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend
  FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm
  that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains
  Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on
  BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\times$
  speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq.
  length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context
  in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2
  and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities:
  the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge
  (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).'
