abstract: Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based ledger and the corresponding consensus
  algorithm has been identified as a promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT).
  Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that have been widely
  used in blockchain, the consensus mechanism designed on DAG structure (simply called
  as DAG consensus) can overcome some shortcomings such as high resource consumption,
  high transaction fee, low transaction throughput and long confirmation delay. However,
  the theoretic analysis on the DAG consensus is an untapped venue to be explored.
  To this end, based on one of the most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate
  the impact of network load on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger.
  Considering unsteady network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture
  the behavior of DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance
  metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on the
  proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the probability
  of a successful double-spending attack in different network load regimes. The results
  can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus process, e.g., how the
  network load affects the confirmation delay and the probability of a successful
  attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the trade-off between security level and
  confirmation delay, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based
  ledgers.
