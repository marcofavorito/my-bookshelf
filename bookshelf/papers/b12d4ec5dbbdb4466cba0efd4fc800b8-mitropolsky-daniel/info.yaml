abstract: 'We present a simulated biologically plausible language organ, made up of
  stylized but realistic neurons, synapses, brain areas, plasticity, and a simplified
  model of sensory perception. We show through experiments that this model succeeds
  in an important early step in language acquisition: the learning of nouns, verbs,
  and their meanings, from the grounded input of only a modest number of sentences.
  Learning in this system is achieved through Hebbian plasticity, and without backpropagation.
  Our model goes beyond a parser previously designed in a similar environment, with
  the critical addition of a biologically plausible account for how language can be
  acquired in the infant''s brain, not just processed by a mature brain.'
