abstract: <p>This book illustrates and assesses the dramatic recent transformations
  in capital markets worldwide and the impact of those transformations. ‘Market making’
  by humans in centralized markets has been replaced by supercomputers and algorithmic
  high frequency trading operating in often highly fragmented markets. How do recent
  market changes impact on core public policy objectives such as investor protection,
  reduction of systemic risk, fairness, efficiency, and transparency in markets? The
  operation and health of capital markets affect all of us and have profound implications
  for equality and justice in society. This unique set of chapters by leading scholars,
  industry insiders, and regulators sheds light on these and related questions and
  discusses ways to strengthen market governance for the benefit of society at large.</p>
