abstract: 'With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant
  quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of
  what happens if we replace a machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While
  such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been
  repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely
  related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces
  to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This
  technical manuscript summarises, formalises and extends the link by systematically
  rephrasing quantum models as a kernel method. It shows that most near-term and fault-tolerant
  quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel
  computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. In particular, kernel-based
  training is guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational
  circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells
  us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient
  that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.'
