abstract: The main driver of inequality--returns on capital that exceed the rate of
  economic growth--is again threatening to generate extreme discontent and undermine
  democratic values. Thomas Piketty's findings in this ambitious, original, rigorous
  work will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought
  about wealth and inequality.
