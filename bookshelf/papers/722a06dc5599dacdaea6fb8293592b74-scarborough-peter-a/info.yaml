abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Modelled dietary scenarios often
  fail to reflect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental
  burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data
  from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level
  data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential
  biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than
  38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production
  and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental
  indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed.
  Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high
  meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1%
  (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for
  eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity. At least 30% differences
  were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial
  variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental
  impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction
  of the latter.</jats:p>
