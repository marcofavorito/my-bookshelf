abstract: An appealing feature of blockchain technology is smart contracts. A smart
  contract is executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute
  and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a
  trusted third party. In this paper, we conduct a systematic mapping study to collect
  all research that is relevant to smart contracts from a technical perspective. The
  aim of doing so is to identify current research topics and open challenges for future
  studies in smart contract research. We extract 24 papers from different scientific
  databases. The results show that about two thirds of the papers focus on identifying
  and tackling smart contract issues. Four key issues are identified, namely, codifying,
  security, privacy and performance issues. The rest of the papers focuses on smart
  contract applications or other smart contract related topics. Research gaps that
  need to be addressed in future studies are provided.
