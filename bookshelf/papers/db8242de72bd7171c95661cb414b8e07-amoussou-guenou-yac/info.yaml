abstract: Tendermint-core blockchains (e.g. Cosmos) are considered today one of the
  most viable alternatives for the highly energy consuming proof-of-work blockchains
  such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their particularity is that they aim at offering strong
  consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two ingredients (i) a set of
  validators that generate blocks via a variant of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant
  (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a selection strategy that dynamically selects
  nodes to be validators for the next block via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the
  exact assumptions on the system model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms
  are correct and the exact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally
  analyzed. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint
  algorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem solved
  by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified version
  of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of one-shot consensus
  for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of the repeated consensus
  problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if the set of validators is
  hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each one-shot consensus instance less
  than one third of the validators is Byzantine. Our second contribution relates to
  the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It is common knowledge that in permisionless
  blockchain systems the main threat is the tragedy of commons that may yield the
  system to collapse if the rewarding mechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding
  mechanism must be fair, i.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit
  of participants. We prove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus
  based blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and only
  if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original Tendermint
  rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original protocol makes it
  eventually fair.
