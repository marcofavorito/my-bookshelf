abstract: Replicated services accessed via {\em quorums} enable each access to be
  performed at only a subset (quorum) of the servers, and achieve consistency across
  accesses by requiring any two quorums to intersect. Recently, $b$-masking quorum
  systems, whose intersections contain at least $2b+1$ servers, have been proposed
  to construct replicated services tolerant of $b$ arbitrary (Byzantine) server failures.
  In this paper we consider a hybrid fault model allowing benign failures in addition
  to the Byzantine ones. We present four novel constructions for $b$-masking quorum
  systems in this model, each of which has optimal {\em load} (the probability of
  access of the busiest server) or optimal availability (probability of some quorum
  surviving failures). To show optimality we also prove lower bounds on the load and
  availability of any $b$-masking quorum system in this model.
