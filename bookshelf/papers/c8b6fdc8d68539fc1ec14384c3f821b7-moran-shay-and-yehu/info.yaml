abstract: Sample compression schemes were defined by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986)
  as an abstraction of the structure underlying many learning algorithms. Roughly
  speaking, a sample compression scheme of size $k$ means that given an arbitrary
  list of labeled examples, one can retain only $k$ of them in a way that allows to
  recover the labels of all other examples in the list. They showed that compression
  implies PAC learnability for binary-labeled classes, and asked whether the other
  direction holds. We answer their question and show that every concept class $C$
  with VC dimension $d$ has a sample compression scheme of size exponential in $d$.
  The proof uses an approximate minimax phenomenon for binary matrices of low VC dimension,
  which may be of interest in the context of game theory.
