abstract: Given a finite set of words w1,...,wn independently drawn according to a
  fixed unknown distribution law P called a stochastic language, an usual goal in
  Grammatical Inference is to infer an estimate of P in some class of probabilistic
  models, such as Probabilistic Automata (PA). Here, we study the class of rational
  stochastic languages, which consists in stochastic languages that can be generated
  by Multiplicity Automata (MA) and which strictly includes the class of stochastic
  languages generated by PA. Rational stochastic languages have minimal normal representation
  which may be very concise, and whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from
  stochastic samples. We design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at
  building a minimal normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no
  recursively enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic
  languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit. We
  study the intermediary MA output by DEES and show that they compute rational series
  which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide stochastic languages
  which closely estimate the target.
