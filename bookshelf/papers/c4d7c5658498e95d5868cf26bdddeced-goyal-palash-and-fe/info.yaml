abstract: Graphs, such as social networks, word co-occurrence networks, and communication
  networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications. Analyzing them yields
  insight into the structure of society, language, and different patterns of communication.
  Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which
  use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from
  the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured
  analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first
  introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality,
  and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three
  categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep
  learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis
  of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods
  on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our
  analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions.
  We finally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph
  Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides
  all presented algorithms within a unified interface to foster and facilitate research
  on the topic.
