abstract: 'In the quest to align deep learning with the sciences to address calls
  for rigor, safety, and interpretability in machine learning systems, this contribution
  identifies key missing pieces: the stages of hypothesis formulation and testing,
  as well as statistical and systematic uncertainty estimation -- core tenets of the
  scientific method. This position paper discusses the ways in which contemporary
  science is conducted in other domains and identifies potentially useful practices.
  We present a case study from physics and describe how this field has promoted rigor
  through specific methodological practices, and provide recommendations on how machine
  learning researchers can adopt these practices into the research ecosystem. We argue
  that both domain-driven experiments and application-agnostic questions of the inner
  workings of fundamental building blocks of machine learning models ought to be examined
  with the tools of the scientific method, to ensure we not only understand effect,
  but also begin to understand cause, which is the raison d''\^{e}tre of science.'
