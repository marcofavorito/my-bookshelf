abstract: Transfer learning aims at improving the performance of target learners on
  target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related
  source domains. In this way, the dependence on a large number of target domain data
  can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects,
  transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although
  there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these
  surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances
  in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area,
  it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies.
  This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches,
  as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer
  learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding
  of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey paper
  reviews more than forty representative transfer learning approaches, especially
  homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model.
  The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show
  the performance of different transfer learning models, over twenty representative
  transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three
  different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. And the
  experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer
  learning models for different applications in practice.
