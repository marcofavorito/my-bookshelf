abstract: The abundance of interconnected data has fueled the design and implementation
  of graph generators reproducing real-world linking properties, or gauging the effectiveness
  of graph algorithms, techniques and applications manipulating these data. We consider
  graph generation across multiple subfields, such as Semantic Web, graph databases,
  social networks, and community detection, along with general graphs. Despite the
  disparate requirements of modern graph generators throughout these communities,
  we analyze them under a common umbrella, reaching out the functionalities, the practical
  usage, and their supported operations. We argue that this classification is serving
  the need of providing scientists, researchers and practitioners with the right data
  generator at hand for their work. This survey provides a comprehensive overview
  of the state-of-the-art graph generators by focusing on those that are pertinent
  and suitable for several data-intensive tasks. Finally, we discuss open challenges
  and missing requirements of current graph generators along with their future extensions
  to new emerging fields.
