abstract: 'Recent developments in decision-making research are bringing the topic
  of planning back to center stage in cognitive science. This renewed interest reopens
  an old, but still unanswered question: how exactly does planning happen? What are
  the underlying information processing operations and how are they implemented in
  the brain? Although a range of interesting possibilities exists, recent work has
  introduced a potentially transformative new idea, according to which planning is
  accomplished through probabilistic inference.'
