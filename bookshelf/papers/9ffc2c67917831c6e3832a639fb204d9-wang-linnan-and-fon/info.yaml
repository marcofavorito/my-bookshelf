abstract: High dimensional black-box optimization has broad applications but remains
  a challenging problem to solve. Given a set of samples $\{\vx_i, y_i\}$, building
  a global model (like Bayesian Optimization (BO)) suffers from the curse of dimensionality
  in the high-dimensional search space, while a greedy search may lead to sub-optimality.
  By recursively splitting the search space into regions with high/low function values,
  recent works like LaNAS shows good performance in Neural Architecture Search (NAS),
  reducing the sample complexity empirically. In this paper, we coin LA-MCTS that
  extends LaNAS to other domains. Unlike previous approaches, LA-MCTS learns the partition
  of the search space using a few samples and their function values in an online fashion.
  While LaNAS uses linear partition and performs uniform sampling in each region,
  our LA-MCTS adopts a nonlinear decision boundary and learns a local model to pick
  good candidates. If the nonlinear partition function and the local model fits well
  with ground-truth black-box function, then good partitions and candidates can be
  reached with much fewer samples. LA-MCTS serves as a \emph{meta-algorithm} by using
  existing black-box optimizers (e.g., BO, TuRBO) as its local models, achieving strong
  performance in general black-box optimization and reinforcement learning benchmarks,
  in particular for high-dimensional problems.
