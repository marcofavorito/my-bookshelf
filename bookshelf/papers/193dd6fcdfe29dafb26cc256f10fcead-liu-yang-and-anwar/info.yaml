abstract: 'The prevalent convolutional neural network (CNN) based image denoising
  methods extract features of images to restore the clean ground truth, achieving
  high denoising accuracy. However, these methods may ignore the underlying distribution
  of clean images, inducing distortions or artifacts in denoising results. This paper
  proposes a new perspective to treat image denoising as a distribution learning and
  disentangling task. Since the noisy image distribution can be viewed as a joint
  distribution of clean images and noise, the denoised images can be obtained via
  manipulating the latent representations to the clean counterpart. This paper also
  provides a distribution learning based denoising framework. Following this framework,
  we present an invertible denoising network, FDN, without any assumptions on either
  clean or noise distributions, as well as a distribution disentanglement method.
  FDN learns the distribution of noisy images, which is different from the previous
  CNN based discriminative mapping. Experimental results demonstrate FDN''s capacity
  to remove synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) on both category-specific
  and remote sensing images. Furthermore, the performance of FDN surpasses that of
  previously published methods in real image denoising with fewer parameters and faster
  speed. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Yang-Liu1082/FDN.git.'
