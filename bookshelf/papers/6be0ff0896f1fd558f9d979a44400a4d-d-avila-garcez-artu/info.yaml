abstract: Current advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
  have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless,
  concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised
  by influential thinkers. Many have identified the need for well-founded knowledge
  representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability.
  Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking
  to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability
  via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent
  and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying
  the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates
  in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation
  and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing
  are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety,
  interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions
  and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic
  systems.
