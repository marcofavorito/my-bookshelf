abstract: This paper proposes a tentative and original survey of meeting points between
  Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) and Machine Learning (ML), two areas
  which have been developing quite separately in the last three decades. Some common
  concerns are identified and discussed such as the types of used representation,
  the roles of knowledge and data, the lack or the excess of information, or the need
  for explanations and causal understanding. Then some methodologies combining reasoning
  and learning are reviewed (such as inductive logic programming, neuro-symbolic reasoning,
  formal concept analysis, rule-based representations and ML, uncertainty in ML, or
  case-based reasoning and analogical reasoning), before discussing examples of synergies
  between KRR and ML (including topics such as belief functions on regression, EM
  algorithm versus revision, the semantic description of vector representations, the
  combination of deep learning with high level inference, knowledge graph completion,
  declarative frameworks for data mining, or preferences and recommendation). This
  paper is the first step of a work in progress aiming at a better mutual understanding
  of research in KRR and ML, and how they could cooperate.
