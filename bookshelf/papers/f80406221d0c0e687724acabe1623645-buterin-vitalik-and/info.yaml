abstract: In this paper we study Privacy Pools, a novel smart contract-based privacy-enhancing
  protocol. We discuss the pros and cons of this protocol, and show how it could be
  employed to create a separating equilibrium between honest and dishonest users.
  The core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof,
  demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources,
  without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph. This is achieved by proving
  membership in custom association sets that satisfy certain properties, required
  by regulation or social consensus. The proposal may be a first step towards a future
  where people could prove regulatory compliance without having to reveal their entire
  transaction history.
