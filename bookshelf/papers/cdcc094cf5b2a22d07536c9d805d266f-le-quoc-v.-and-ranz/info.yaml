abstract: We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors
  from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using
  only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse
  autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of
  images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200
  pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism
  and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days.
  Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results
  reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images
  as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector
  is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation.
  We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such
  as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained
  our network to obtain 15.8% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from
  ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.
