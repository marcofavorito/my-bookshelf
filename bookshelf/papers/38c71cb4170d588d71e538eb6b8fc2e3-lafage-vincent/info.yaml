abstract: The differences between the sets in which ideal arithmetics takes place
  and the sets of floating point numbers are outlined. A set of classical problems
  in correct numerical evaluation is presented, to increase the awareness of newcomers
  to the field. A self-defense, prophylactic approach to numerical computation is
  advocated.
