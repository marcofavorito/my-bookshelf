abstract: We investigate the Church-Kalm\'ar-Kreisel-Turing Theses concerning theoretical
  (necessary) limitations of future computers and of deductive sciences, in view of
  recent results of classical general relativity theory.   We argue that (i) there
  are several distinguished Church-Turing-type Theses (not only one) and (ii) validity
  of some of these theses depend on the background physical theory we choose to use.
  In particular, if we choose classical general relativity theory as our background
  theory, then the above mentioned limitations (predicted by these Theses) become
  no more necessary, hence certain forms of the Church-Turing Thesis cease to be valid
  (in general relativity). (For other choices of the background theory the answer
  might be different.)   We also look at various ``obstacles'' to computing a non-recursive
  function (by relying on relativistic phenomena) published in the literature and
  show that they can be avoided (by improving the ``design'' of our future computer).
  We also ask ourselves, how all this reflects on the arithmetical hierarchy and the
  analytical hierarchy of uncomputable functions.
