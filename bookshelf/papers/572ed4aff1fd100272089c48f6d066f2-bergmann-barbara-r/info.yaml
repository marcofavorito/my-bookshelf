abstract: '<jats:p> Simulation models, now widely used in the physical sciences, can
  also help economists in depicting the actions and interactions of individuals and
  firms through time. This article provides an introduction to microsimulation: how
  it works, how to do it, its potential, and its drawbacks. It then allows readers,
  even those with no experience in computer programming, to work through the details
  of a simple microsimulation model. Readers can put this model on their PCs, watch
  it run through its paces, and experiment with their own modifications. With this
  model as an example, it should be fairly easy to create programs for new models
  on other subjects for use in theoretical exploration, empirical research, or classroom
  demonstrations. The demonstration model I present depicts the experience of individual
  workers during recession and recovery in the labor market. As the model runs, its
  internal” Census Bureau” performs surveys on the microlevel, and sums up to macrolevel
  variables. The model is simple, but it has some interesting applications. After
  explaining how to set it up, I use it to explore the effect of unemployment insurance
  on the level of unemployment and to point up a common fallacy in current labor market
  literature. </jats:p>'
