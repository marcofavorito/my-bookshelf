abstract: Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency, and an accompanying protocol,
  created in 2008. Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate blocks---collections
  of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's ledger. Block creation
  requires nodes to invest computational resources, but also carries a reward in the
  form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator. While the protocol requires nodes
  to quickly distribute newly created blocks, strong nodes can in fact gain higher
  payoffs by withholding blocks they create and selectively postponing their publication.
  The existence of such selfish mining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer,
  who have demonstrated a specific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy
  that we name SM1).   In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining
  attacks, and provide an algorithm to find $\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers
  within the model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies.
  As a consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power
  an attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the profit
  threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable attack
  -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the policies
  given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating attack-withdrawals.   Using
  our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure to selfish
  mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next, we gain insight
  into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays, and show that, under
  a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold vanishes, and even small
  attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from the protocol. We conclude
  with observations regarding the combined power of selfish mining and double spending
  attacks.
