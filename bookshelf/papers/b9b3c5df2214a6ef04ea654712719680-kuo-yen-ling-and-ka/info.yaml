abstract: <jats:p>We demonstrate how a reinforcement learning agent can use compositional
  recurrent neural networks to learn to carry out commands specified in linear temporal
  logic (LTL). Our approach takes as input an LTL formula, structures a deep network
  according to the parse of the formula, and determines satisfying actions. This compositional
  structure of the network enables zero-shot generalization to significantly more
  complex unseen formulas. We demonstrate this ability in multiple problem domains
  with both discrete and continuous state-action spaces. In a symbolic domain, the
  agent finds a sequence of letters that satisfy a specification. In a Minecraft-like
  environment, the agent finds a sequence of actions that conform to a formula. In
  the Fetch environment, the robot finds a sequence of arm configurations that move
  blocks on a table to fulfill the commands. While most prior work can learn to execute
  one formula reliably, we develop a novel form of multi-task learning for RL agents
  that allows them to learn from a diverse set of tasks and generalize to a new set
  of diverse tasks without any additional training. The compositional structures presented
  here are not specific to LTL, thus opening the path to RL agents that perform zero-shot
  generalization in other compositional domains.</jats:p>
