abstract: <p>What are the methodologies that we should employ for designing and evaluating
  governmental policy, in light of the profound effects that policies have on the
  level and distribution of individuals’ well-being? <italic>The Oxford Handbook of
  Well-Being and Public Policy</italic> is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment
  of this question—drawing from welfare economics, moral philosophy, and psychology.
  Part I of the Handbook covers policy-assessment methodologies, both established
  and emerging. Part II reviews philosophical conceptions of well-being, and the literature
  on “subjective well-being” in psychology and economics.  The chapters in Part III
  focus specifically on well-being measurement, proposing or empirically illustrating
  various approaches to constructing a comprehensive individual-level indicator of
  well-being—or, alternatively, defending a “multidimensional” approach that eschews
  such a measure. Part IV reviews a variety of challenges for policy assessment. ThisThe
  Iintroductory chapter describes the Handbook structure and the role that each chapter
  plays therein, and highlights a number of key Handbook themes. </p>
