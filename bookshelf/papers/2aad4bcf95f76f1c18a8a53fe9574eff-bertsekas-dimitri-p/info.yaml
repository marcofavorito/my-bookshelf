abstract: We consider a stochastic version of the classical shortest path problem
  whereby for each node of a graph, we must choose a probability distribution over
  the set of successor nodes so as to reach a certain destination node with minimum
  expected cost. The costs of transition between successive nodes can be positive
  as well as negative. We prove natural generalizations of the standard results for
  the deterministic shortest path problem, and we extend the corresponding theory
  for undiscounted finite state Markovian decision problems by removing the usual
  restriction that costs are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive.
