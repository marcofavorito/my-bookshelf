abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning
  (RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential decision-making
  problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the
  games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation
  of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent
  RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged
  due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical
  foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter,
  we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical
  analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms
  mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form
  games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative,
  fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but
  challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews
  on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including
  learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL
  in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning
  in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors
  and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment
  of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research
  directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing
  stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging
  topic.
