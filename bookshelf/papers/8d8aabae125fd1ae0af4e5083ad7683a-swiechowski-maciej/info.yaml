abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful approach to designing game-playing
  bots or solving sequential decision problems. The method relies on intelligent tree
  search that balances exploration and exploitation. MCTS performs random sampling
  in the form of simulations and stores statistics of actions to make more educated
  choices in each subsequent iteration. The method has become a state-of-the-art technique
  for combinatorial games, however, in more complex games (e.g. those with high branching
  factor or real-time ones), as well as in various practical domains (e.g. transportation,
  scheduling or security) an efficient MCTS application often requires its problem-dependent
  modification or integration with other techniques. Such domain-specific modifications
  and hybrid approaches are the main focus of this survey. The last major MCTS survey
  has been published in 2012. Contributions that appeared since its release are of
  particular interest for this review.
