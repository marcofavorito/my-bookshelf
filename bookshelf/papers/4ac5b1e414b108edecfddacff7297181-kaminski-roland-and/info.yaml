abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) has become a popular and quite sophisticated
  approach to declarative problem solving. This is arguably due to its attractive
  modeling-grounding-solving workflow that provides an easy approach to problem solving,
  even for laypersons outside computer science. Unlike this, the high degree of sophistication
  of the underlying technology makes it increasingly hard for ASP experts to put ideas
  into practice.   For addressing this issue, this tutorial aims at enabling users
  to build their own ASP-based systems. More precisely, we show how the ASP system
  CLINGO can be used for extending ASP and for implementing customized special-purpose
  systems. To this end, we propose two alternatives. We begin with a traditional AI
  technique and show how meta programming can be used for extending ASP. This is a
  rather light approach that relies on CLINGO's reification feature to use ASP itself
  for expressing new functionalities. Unlike this, the major part of this tutorial
  uses traditional programming (in PYTHON) for manipulating CLINGO via its application
  programming interface. This approach allows for changing and controlling the entire
  model-ground-solve workflow of ASP. Central to this is CLINGO's new Application
  class that allows us to draw on CLINGO's infrastructure by customizing processes
  similar to the one in CLINGO. For instance, we may engage manipulations to programs'
  abstract syntax trees, control various forms of multi-shot solving, and set up theory
  propagators for foreign inferences. Another cross-sectional structure, spanning
  meta as well as application programming, is CLINGO's intermediate format, ASPIF,
  that specifies the interface among the underlying grounder and solver. We illustrate
  the aforementioned concepts and techniques throughout this tutorial by means of
  examples and several non-trivial case-studies.
