abstract: 'We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based
  on Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities,
  support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for
  programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications:
  foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and
  instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters
  each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on
  inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants
  support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art
  performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53%
  and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms
  Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly
  available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that
  allows for both research and commercial use.'
