abstract: 'We propose a new and simple adaptive procedure for playing a game: regret-matching.
  In this procedure, players may depart from their current play with probabilities
  that are proportional to measures of regret for not having used other strategies
  in the past. It is shown that our adaptive procedure guarantees that, with probability
  one, the empirical distributions of play converge to the set of correlated equilibria
  of the game.'
