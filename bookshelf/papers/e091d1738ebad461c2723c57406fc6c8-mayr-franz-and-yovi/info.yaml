abstract: 'We propose a new active learning algorithm for PDFA based on three main
  aspects: a congruence over states which takes into account next-symbol probability
  distributions, a quantization that copes with differences in distributions, and
  an efficient tree-based data structure. Experiments showed significant performance
  gains with respect to reference implementations.'
