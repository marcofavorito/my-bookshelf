abstract: 'The growing need to deal with massive instances motivates the design of
  algorithms balancing the quality of the solution with applicability. For the latter,
  an important measure is the \emph{adaptive complexity}, capturing the number of
  sequential rounds of parallel computation needed. In this work we obtain the first
  \emph{constant factor} approximation algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization
  subject to a knapsack constraint with \emph{near-optimal} $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity.
  Low adaptivity by itself, however, is not enough: one needs to account for the total
  number of function evaluations (or value queries) as well. Our algorithm asks $\tilde{O}(n^2)$
  value queries, but can be modified to run with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ instead, while
  retaining a low adaptive complexity of $O(\log^2n)$. Besides the above improvement
  in adaptivity, this is also the first \emph{combinatorial} approach with sublinear
  adaptive complexity for the problem and yields algorithms comparable to the state-of-the-art
  even for the special cases of cardinality constraints or monotone objectives. Finally,
  we showcase our algorithms'' applicability on real-world datasets.'
