abstract: We present a new method for computing core universal solutions in data exchange
  settings specified by source-to-target dependencies, by means of SQL queries. Unlike
  previously known algorithms, which are recursive in nature, our method can be implemented
  directly on top of any DBMS. Our method is based on the new notion of a laconic
  schema mapping. A laconic schema mapping is a schema mapping for which the canonical
  universal solution is the core universal solution. We give a procedure by which
  every schema mapping specified by FO s-t tgds can be turned into a laconic schema
  mapping specified by FO s-t tgds that may refer to a linear order on the domain
  of the source instance. We show that our results are optimal, in the sense that
  the linear order is necessary and the method cannot be extended to schema mapping
  involving target constraints.
