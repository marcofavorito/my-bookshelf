abstract: We propose a framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of
  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models and their precursors. This framework
  introduces levels of AGI performance, generality, and autonomy. It is our hope that
  this framework will be useful in an analogous way to the levels of autonomous driving,
  by providing a common language to compare models, assess risks, and measure progress
  along the path to AGI. To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions
  of AGI, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for AGI should satisfy.
  These principles include focusing on capabilities rather than mechanisms; separately
  evaluating generality and performance; and defining stages along the path toward
  AGI, rather than focusing on the endpoint. With these principles in mind, we propose
  'Levels of AGI' based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality) of capabilities,
  and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging
  requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and capabilities of
  AGI models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels of AGI interact
  with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance
  of carefully selecting Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment
  of highly capable AI systems.
