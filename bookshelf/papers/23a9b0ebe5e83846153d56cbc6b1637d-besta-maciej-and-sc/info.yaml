abstract: The growing size of data center and HPC networks pose unprecedented requirements
  on the scalability of simulation infrastructure. The ability to simulate such large-scale
  interconnects on a simple PC would facilitate research efforts. Unfortunately, as
  we first show in this work, existing shared-memory packet-level simulators do not
  scale to the sizes of the largest networks considered today. We then illustrate
  a feasibility analysis and a set of enhancements that enable a simple packet-level
  htsim simulator to scale to the unprecedented simulation sizes on a single PC. Our
  code is available online and can be used to design novel schemes in the coming era
  of omnipresent data centers and HPC clusters.
