abstract: We study the problem of designing posted-price mechanisms in order to sell
  a single unit of a single item within a finite period of time. Motivated by real-world
  problems, such as, e.g., long-term rental of rooms and apartments, we assume that
  customers arrive online according to a Poisson process, and their valuations are
  drawn from an unknown distribution and discounted over time. We evaluate our mechanisms
  in terms of competitive ratio, measuring the worst-case ratio between their revenue
  and that of an optimal mechanism that knows the distribution of valuations. First,
  we focus on the identical valuation setting, where all the customers value the item
  for the same amount. In this setting, we provide a mechanism M_c that achieves the
  best possible competitive ratio, discussing its dependency on the parameters in
  the case of linear discount. Then, we switch to the random valuation setting. We
  show that, if we restrict the attention to distributions of valuations with a monotone
  hazard rate, then the competitive ratio of M_c is lower bounded by a strictly positive
  constant that does not depend on the distribution. Moreover, we provide another
  mechanism, called M_pc, which is defined by a piecewise constant pricing strategy
  and reaches performances comparable to those obtained with M_c. This mechanism is
  useful when the seller cannot change the posted price too often. Finally, we empirically
  evaluate the performances of our mechanisms in a number of experimental settings.
