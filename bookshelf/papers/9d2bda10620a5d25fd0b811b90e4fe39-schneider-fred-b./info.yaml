abstract: The state machine approach is a general method for implementing fault-tolerant
  services in distributed systems. This paper reviews the approach and describes protocols
  for two different failure models—Byzantine and fail stop. Systems reconfiguration
  techniques for removing faulty components and integrating repaired components are
  also discussed.
