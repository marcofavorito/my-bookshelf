abstract: We introduce ABIDES, an Agent-Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulation
  environment. ABIDES is designed from the ground up to support AI agent research
  in market applications. While simulations are certainly available within trading
  firms for their own internal use, there are no broadly available high-fidelity market
  simulation environments. We hope that the availability of such a platform will facilitate
  AI research in this important area. ABIDES currently enables the simulation of tens
  of thousands of trading agents interacting with an exchange agent to facilitate
  transactions. It supports configurable pairwise network latencies between each individual
  agent as well as the exchange. Our simulator's message-based design is modeled after
  NASDAQ's published equity trading protocols ITCH and OUCH. We introduce the design
  of the simulator and illustrate its use and configuration with sample code, validating
  the environment with example trading scenarios. The utility of ABIDES is illustrated
  through experiments to develop a market impact model. We close with discussion of
  future experimental problems it can be used to explore, such as the development
  of ML-based trading algorithms.
