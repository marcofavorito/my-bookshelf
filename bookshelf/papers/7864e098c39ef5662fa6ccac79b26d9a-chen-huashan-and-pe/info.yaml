abstract: 'The blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many
  application domains, especially financial applications. While the first generation
  of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency
  purposes, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum,
  is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing --- Decentralized
  Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics
  of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts
  in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex,
  system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on
  its security from a holistic perspective, which is unavailable. To the best of our
  knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this
  void. In particular, we systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security:
  vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into, among other things,
  vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which
  shed light on future research directions.'
