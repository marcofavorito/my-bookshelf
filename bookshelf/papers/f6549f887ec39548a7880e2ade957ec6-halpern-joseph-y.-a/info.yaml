abstract: At the heart of the Bitcoin is a blockchain protocol, a protocol for achieving
  consensus on a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. To the extent that
  a blockchain protocol is used for applications such as contract signing and making
  certain transactions (such as house sales) public, we need to understand what guarantees
  the protocol gives us in terms of agents' knowledge. Here, we provide a complete
  characterization of agent's knowledge when running a blockchain protocol using a
  variant of common knowledge that takes into account the fact that agents can enter
  and leave the system, it is not known which agents are in fact following the protocol
  (some agents may want to deviate if they can gain by doing so), and the fact that
  the guarantees provided by blockchain protocols are probabilistic. We then consider
  some scenarios involving contracts and show that this level of knowledge suffices
  for some scenarios, but not others.
