abstract: This research underscores the importance of financial derivative contracts
  as use cases for blockchain technology in general and for smart contracts in particular.
  Blockchain and decentralized apps can increase transparency, automate the movement
  of collateral, reduce the need for reconciliation, and automate the management of
  covenants against counterparty default.
