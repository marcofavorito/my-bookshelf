abstract: This paper develops an algorithmic-based approach for proving inductive
  properties of propositional sequent systems such as admissibility, invertibility,
  cut-elimination, and identity expansion. Although undecidable in general, these
  structural properties are crucial in proof theory because they can reduce the proof-search
  effort and further be used as scaffolding for obtaining other meta-results such
  as consistency. The algorithms -- which take advantage of the rewriting logic meta-logical
  framework, and use rewrite- and narrowing-based reasoning -- are explained in detail
  and illustrated with examples throughout the paper. They have been fully mechanized
  in the L-Framework, thus offering both a formal specification language and off-the-shelf
  mechanization of the proof-search algorithms coming together with semi-decision
  procedures for proving theorems and meta-theorems of the object system. As illustrated
  with case studies in the paper, the L-Framework, achieves a great degree of automation
  when used on several propositional sequent systems, including single conclusion
  and multi-conclusion intuitionistic logic, classical logic, classical linear logic
  and its dyadic system, intuitionistic linear logic, and normal modal logics.
