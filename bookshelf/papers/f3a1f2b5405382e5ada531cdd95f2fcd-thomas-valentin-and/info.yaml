abstract: It has been postulated that a good representation is one that disentangles
  the underlying explanatory factors of variation. However, it remains an open question
  what kind of training framework could potentially achieve that. Whereas most previous
  work focuses on the static setting (e.g., with images), we postulate that some of
  the causal factors could be discovered if the learner is allowed to interact with
  its environment. The agent can experiment with different actions and observe their
  effects. More specifically, we hypothesize that some of these factors correspond
  to aspects of the environment which are independently controllable, i.e., that there
  exists a policy and a learnable feature for each such aspect of the environment,
  such that this policy can yield changes in that feature with minimal changes to
  other features that explain the statistical variations in the observed data. We
  propose a specific objective function to find such factors and verify experimentally
  that it can indeed disentangle independently controllable aspects of the environment
  without any extrinsic reward signal.
