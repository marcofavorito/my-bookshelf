abstract: 'Despite artificial intelligence (AI) having transformed major aspects of
  our society, less than a fraction of its potential has been explored, let alone
  deployed, for education. AI-powered learning can provide millions of learners with
  a highly personalized, active and practical learning experience, which is key to
  successful learning. This is especially relevant in the context of online learning
  platforms. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative head-to-head study
  on learning outcomes for two popular online learning platforms (n=199 participants):
  A MOOC platform following a traditional model delivering content using lecture videos
  and multiple-choice quizzes, and the Korbit learning platform providing a highly
  personalized, active and practical learning experience. We observe a huge and statistically
  significant increase in the learning outcomes, with students on the Korbit platform
  providing full feedback resulting in higher course completion rates and achieving
  learning gains 2 to 2.5 times higher than both students on the MOOC platform and
  students in a control group who don''t receive personalized feedback on the Korbit
  platform. The results demonstrate the tremendous impact that can be achieved with
  a personalized, active learning AI-powered system. Making this technology and learning
  experience available to millions of learners around the world will represent a significant
  leap forward towards the democratization of education.'
