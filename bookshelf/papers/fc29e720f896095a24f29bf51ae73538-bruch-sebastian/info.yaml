abstract: 'Vectors are universal mathematical objects that can represent text, images,
  speech, or a mix of these data modalities. That happens regardless of whether data
  is represented by hand-crafted features or learnt embeddings. Collect a large enough
  quantity of such vectors and the question of retrieval becomes urgently relevant:
  Finding vectors that are more similar to a query vector. This monograph is concerned
  with the question above and covers fundamental concepts along with advanced data
  structures and algorithms for vector retrieval. In doing so, it recaps this fascinating
  topic and lowers barriers of entry into this rich area of research.'
