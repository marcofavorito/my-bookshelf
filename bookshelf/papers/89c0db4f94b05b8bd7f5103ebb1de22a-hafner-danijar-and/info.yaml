abstract: We introduce a unified objective for action and perception of intelligent
  agents. Extending representation learning and control, we minimize the joint divergence
  between the combined system of agent and environment and a target distribution.
  Intuitively, such agents use perception to align their beliefs with the world, and
  use actions to align the world with their beliefs. Minimizing the joint divergence
  to an expressive target maximizes the mutual information between the agent's representations
  and inputs, thus inferring representations that are informative of past inputs and
  exploring future inputs that are informative of the representations. This lets us
  explain intrinsic objectives, such as representation learning, information gain,
  empowerment, and skill discovery from minimal assumptions. Moreover, interpreting
  the target distribution as a latent variable model suggests powerful world models
  as a path toward highly adaptive agents that seek large niches in their environments,
  rendering task rewards optional. The framework provides a common language for comparing
  a wide range of objectives, advances the understanding of latent variables for decision
  making, and offers a recipe for designing novel objectives. We recommend deriving
  future agent objectives the joint divergence to facilitate comparison, to point
  out the agent's target distribution, and to identify the intrinsic objective terms
  needed to reach that distribution.
