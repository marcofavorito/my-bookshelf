abstract: In this paper, we develop a variational method to track and make predictions
  about a real-world system from continuous imperfect observations about this system,
  using an agent-based model that describes the system dynamics. By combining the
  power of big data with the power of model-thinking in the stochastic process framework,
  we can make many valuable predictions. We show how to track the spread of an epidemic
  at the individual level and how to make short-term predictions about traffic congestion.
  This method points to a new way to bring together modelers and data miners by turning
  the real world into a living lab.
