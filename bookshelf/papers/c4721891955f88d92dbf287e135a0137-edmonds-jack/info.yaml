abstract: <jats:p>A <jats:italic>graph G</jats:italic> for purposes here is a finite
  set of elements called <jats:italic>vertices</jats:italic> and a finite set of elements
  called <jats:italic>edges</jats:italic> such that each edge <jats:italic>meets</jats:italic>
  exactly two vertices, called the <jats:italic>end-points</jats:italic> of the edge.
  An edge is said to <jats:italic>join</jats:italic> its end-points.</jats:p><jats:p>A
  <jats:italic>matching</jats:italic> in <jats:italic>G</jats:italic> is a subset
  of its edges such that no two meet the same vertex. We describe an efficient algorithm
  for finding in a given graph a matching of maximum cardinality. This problem was
  posed and partly solved by C. Berge; see Sections 3.7 and 3.8.</jats:p>
