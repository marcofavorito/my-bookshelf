abstract: 'From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface)Man has within a single
  generation found himself sharing the world with a strange new species: the computers
  and computer-like machines. Neither history, nor philosophy, nor common sense will
  tell us how these machines will affect us, for they do not do work as did machines
  of the Industrial Revolution. Instead of dealing with materials or energy, we are
  told that they handle control and information and even "intellectual processes."
  There are very few individuals today who doubt that the computer and its relatives
  are developing rapidly in capability and complexity, and that these machines are
  destined to play important (though not as yet fully understood) roles in society''s
  future. Though only some of us deal directly with computers, all of us are falling
  under the shadow of their ever-growing sphere of influence, and thus we all need
  to understand their capabilities and their limitations.It would indeed be reassuring
  to have a book that categorically and systematically described what all these machines
  can do and what they cannot do, giving sound theoretical or practical grounds for
  each judgment. However, although some books have purported to do this, it cannot
  be done for the following reasons: a) Computer-like devices are utterly unlike anything
  which science has ever considered---we still lack the tools necessary to fully analyze,
  synthesize, or even think about them; and b) The methods discovered so far are effective
  in certain areas, but are developing much too rapidly to allow a useful interpretation
  and interpolation of results. The abstract theory---as described in this book---tells
  us in no uncertain terms that the machines'' potential range is enormous, and that
  its theoretical limitations are of the subtlest and most elusive sort. There is
  no reason to suppose machines have any limitations not shared by man.'
