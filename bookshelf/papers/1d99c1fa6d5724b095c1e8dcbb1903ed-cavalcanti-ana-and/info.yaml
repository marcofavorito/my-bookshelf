abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Hoare and He’s unifying\
  \ theories of programming (UTP) is a model of alphabetised relations expressed as\
  \ predicates; it supports development in several programming paradigms. The aim\
  \ of Hoare and He’s work is the unification of languages and techniques, so that\
  \ we can benefit from results in different contexts. In this paper, we investigate\
  \ the integration of angelic nondeterminism in the UTP; we propose the unification\
  \ of a model of binary multirelations, which is isomorphic to the monotonic predicate\
  \ transformers model and can express angelic and demonic nondeterminism.</jats:p>"
