abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We present a scalable architecture
  for electronic retail payments via central bank digital currency and offer a solution
  to the perceived conflict between robust regulatory oversight and consumer affordances
  such as privacy and control. Our architecture combines existing work in payment
  systems and digital currency with a new approach to digital asset design for managing
  unforgeable, stateful, and oblivious assets without relying on either a central
  authority or a monolithic consensus system. Regulated financial institutions have
  a role in every transaction, and the consumer affordances are achieved through the
  use of non-custodial wallets that unlink the sender from the recipient in the transaction
  channel. This approach is fully compatible with the existing two-tiered banking
  system and can complement and extend the roles of existing money services businesses
  and asset custodians.</jats:p>
