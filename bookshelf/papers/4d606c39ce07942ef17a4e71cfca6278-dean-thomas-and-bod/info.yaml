abstract: 'This paper presents a framework for exploring issues in time-dependent
  planning: planning in which the time available to respond to predicted events varies,
  and the decision making required to formulate effective responses is complex. Our
  analysis of time-dependent planning suggests an approach based on a class of algorithms
  that we call anytime algorithms. Anytime algorithms can be interrupted at any point
  during computation to return a result whose utility is a function of computation
  time. We explore methods for solving time-dependent planning problems based on the
  properties of anytime algorithms.'
