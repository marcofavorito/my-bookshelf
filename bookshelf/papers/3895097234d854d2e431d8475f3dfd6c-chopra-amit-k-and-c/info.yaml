abstract: '<jats:p>Communication protocols are central to engineering decentralized
  multiagent systems. Modern protocol languages are typically formal and address aspects
  of decentralization, such as asynchrony. However, modern languages differ in important
  ways in their basic abstractions and operational assumptions. This diversity makes
  a comparative evaluation of protocol languages a challenging task.&#x0D;

  We contribute a rich evaluation of diverse and modern protocol languages. Among
  the selected languages, Scribble is based on session types; Trace-C and Trace-F
  on trace expressions; HAPN on hierarchical state machines, and BSPL on information
  causality. Our contribution is four-fold. One, we contribute important criteria
  for evaluating protocol languages. Two, for each criterion, we compare the languages
  on the basis of whether they are able to specify elementary protocols that go to
  the heart of the criterion. Three, for each language, we map our findings to a canonical
  architecture style for multiagent systems, highlighting where the languages depart
  from the architecture. Four, we identify design principles for protocol languages
  as guidance for future research.</jats:p>'
