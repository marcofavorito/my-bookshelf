abstract: ’This is essential’ Margaret Atwood on Twitter‘She's one of the most acute
  and perceptive analysts of the furtive growth of fascism. Everyone should know about
  this’ Philip Pullman’Vibrates with outrage’ The TimesAn urgent call to action from
  one of Europe’s most well-regarded political thinkers, and a field guide to spotting
  the insidious patterns and mechanisms of the populist wave sweeping the globe –
  before it’s too late.‘It couldn’t happen here’Ece Temelkuran heard reasonable people
  in Britain say it the night of the Brexit vote.She heard reasonable people in America
  say it the night Trump’s election was soundtracked by chants of ‘Build that wall.’She
  heard reasonable people in Turkey say it as Erdoğan rigged elections, rebuilt the
  economy around cronyism, and labelled his opposition as terrorists.How to Lose a
  Country is an impassioned plea, a warning to the world that populism and nationalism
  don’t march fully-formed into government; they creep. Award winning author and journalist
  Ece Temelkuran identifies the early-warning signs of this phenomenon, sprouting
  up across the world, in order to define a global pattern, and arm the reader with
  the tools to root it out.Proposing alternative, global answers to the pressing –
  and too often paralysing – political questions of our time, Temelkuran explores
  the insidious idea of ‘real people’, the infantilisation of language and debate,
  the way laughter can prove a false friend, and the dangers of underestimating one’s
  opponent. She weaves memoir, history and clear-sighted argument into an urgent and
  eloquent defence of democracy.No longer can the reasonable comfort themselves with
  ‘it couldn’t happen here.’ It is happening. And soon it may be too late.
