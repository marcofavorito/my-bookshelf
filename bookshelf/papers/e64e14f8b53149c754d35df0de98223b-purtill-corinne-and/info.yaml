abstract: Before epilepsy was understood to be a neurological condition, people believed
  it was caused by the moon, or by phlegm in the brain. They condemned seizures as
  evidence of witchcraft or demonic possession, and killed or castrated sufferers
  to prevent them from passing tainted blood to a new generation.
