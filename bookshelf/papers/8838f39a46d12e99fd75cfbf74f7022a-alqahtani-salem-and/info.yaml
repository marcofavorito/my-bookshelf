abstract: Most of the Blockchain permissioned systems employ Byzantine fault-tolerance
  (BFT) consensus protocols to ensure that honest validators agree on the order for
  appending entries to their ledgers. In this paper, we study the performance and
  the scalability of prominent consensus protocols, namely PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff,
  and Streamlet, both analytically via load formulas and practically via implementation
  and evaluation. Under identical conditions, we identify the bottlenecks of these
  consensus protocols and show that these protocols do not scale well as the number
  of validators increases. Our investigation points to the communication complexity
  as the culprit. Even when there is enough network bandwidth, the CPU cost of serialization
  and deserialization of the messages limits the throughput and increases the latency
  of the protocols. To alleviate the bottlenecks, the most useful techniques include
  reducing the communication complexity, rotating the hotspot of communications, and
  pipelining across consensus instances.
