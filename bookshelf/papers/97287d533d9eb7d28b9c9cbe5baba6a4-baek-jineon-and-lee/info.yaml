abstract: Conway and Soifer showed that an equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$
  with sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ can be covered by $n^2 + 2$ unit equilateral
  triangles. They conjectured that it is impossible to cover $T$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit
  equilateral triangles no matter how small $\varepsilon$ is.   We show that if we
  require all sides of the unit equilateral triangles to be parallel to the sides
  of $T$ (e.g. $\bigtriangleup$ and $\bigtriangledown$), then it is impossible to
  cover $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles for
  any $\varepsilon > 0$. As the coverings of $T$ by Conway and Soifer only involve
  triangles with sides parallel to $T$, our result determines the exact minimum number
  $n^2+2$ of unit equilateral triangles with all sides parallel to $T$ that cover
  $T$. We also determine the largest value $\varepsilon = 1/(n + 1)$ (resp. $\varepsilon
  = 1 / n$) of $\varepsilon$ such that the equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$
  can be covered by $n^2+2$ (resp. $n^2 + 3$) unit equilateral triangles with sides
  parallel to $T$, where the first case is achieved by the construction of Conway
  and Soifer.
