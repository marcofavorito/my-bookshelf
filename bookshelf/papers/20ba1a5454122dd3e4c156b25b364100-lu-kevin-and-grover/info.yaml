abstract: We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language
  to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without
  finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks.
  We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and
  study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical
  computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which
  investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show
  that pretraining on natural language improves performance and compute efficiency
  on non-language downstream tasks. In particular, we find that such pretraining enables
  FPT to generalize in zero-shot to these modalities, matching the performance of
  a transformer fully trained on these tasks.
