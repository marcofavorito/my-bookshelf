abstract: DatalogMTL is an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators that
  has found applications in temporal ontology-based data access and query answering,
  as well as in stream reasoning. Practical algorithms for DatalogMTL are reliant
  on materialisation-based reasoning, where temporal facts are derived in a forward
  chaining manner in successive rounds of rule applications. Current materialisation-based
  procedures are, however, based on a naive evaluation strategy, where the main source
  of inefficiency stems from redundant computations.   In this paper, we propose a
  materialisation-based procedure which, analogously to the classical seminaive algorithm
  in Datalog, aims at minimising redundant computation by ensuring that each temporal
  rule instance is considered at most once during the execution of the algorithm.
  Our experiments show that our optimised seminaive strategy for DatalogMTL is able
  to significantly reduce materialisation times.
