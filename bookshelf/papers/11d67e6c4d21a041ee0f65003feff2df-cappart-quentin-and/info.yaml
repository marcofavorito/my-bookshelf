abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research
  and computer science. Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem
  instances in isolation, ignoring the fact that they often stem from related data
  distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in
  using machine learning, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), as a key building
  block for combinatorial tasks, either as solvers or as helper functions. GNNs are
  an inductive bias that effectively encodes combinatorial and relational input due
  to their permutation-invariance and sparsity awareness. This paper presents a conceptual
  review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, aiming at both the optimization
  and machine learning researcher.
