abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning to satisfy temporal logic
  specifications with a group of agents in an unknown environment, which may exhibit
  probabilistic behaviour. From a learning perspective these specifications provide
  a rich formal language with which to capture tasks or objectives, while from a logic
  and automated verification perspective the introduction of learning capabilities
  allows for practical applications in large, stochastic, unknown environments. The
  existing work in this area is, however, limited. Of the frameworks that consider
  full linear temporal logic or have correctness guarantees, all methods thus far
  consider only the case of a single temporal logic specification and a single agent.
  In order to overcome this limitation, we develop the first multi-agent reinforcement
  learning technique for temporal logic specifications, which is also novel in its
  ability to handle multiple specifications. We provide correctness and convergence
  guarantees for our main algorithm - ALMANAC (Automaton/Logic Multi-Agent Natural
  Actor-Critic) - even when using function approximation. Alongside our theoretical
  results, we further demonstrate the applicability of our technique via a set of
  preliminary experiments.
