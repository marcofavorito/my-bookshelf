abstract: 'We define a financial bubble as a period of unsustainable growth, when
  the price of an asset increases ever more quickly, in a series of accelerating phases
  of corrections and rebounds. More technically, during a bubble phase, the price
  follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often accompanied by
  log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a change of regime that
  may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they leave such specific traces,
  bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is, before they burst. In this paper,
  we will explain the mechanism behind financial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will
  show how the log-periodic power law emerges spontaneously from the complex system
  that financial markets are, as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical
  structure and specific trading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the
  risk of a major correction, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops
  towards maturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles
  and to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. The tools that
  are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose. They are at the core of
  the Financial Crisis Observatory at the ETH Zurich, where tens of thousands of assets
  are monitored on a daily basis. This allow us to have a continuous overview of emerging
  bubbles in the global financial markets. The companion report available as part
  of the Notenstein white paper series (2014) with the title ``Financial bubbles:
  mechanism, diagnostic and state of the World (Feb. 2014)'''' presents a practical
  application of the methodology outlines in this article and describes our view of
  the status concerning positive and negative bubbles in the financial markets, as
  of the end of January 2014.'
