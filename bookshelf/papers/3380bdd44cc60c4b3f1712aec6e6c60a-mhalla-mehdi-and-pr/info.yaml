abstract: A 5x5 board is the smallest board on which one can set up all kind of chess
  pieces as a start position. We consider Gardner's minichess variant in which all
  pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game has roughly
  9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly
  solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to
  draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly
  small computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained
  is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.
