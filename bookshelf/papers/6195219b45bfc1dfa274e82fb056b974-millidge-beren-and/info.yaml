abstract: The backpropagation of error algorithm used to train deep neural networks
  has been fundamental to the successes of deep learning. However, it requires sequential
  backward updates and non-local computations, which make it challenging to parallelize
  at scale and is unlike how learning works in the brain. Neuroscience-inspired learning
  algorithms, however, such as \emph{predictive coding}, which utilize local learning,
  have the potential to overcome these limitations and advance beyond current deep
  learning technologies. While predictive coding originated in theoretical neuroscience
  as a model of information processing in the cortex, recent work has developed the
  idea into a general-purpose algorithm able to train neural networks using only local
  computations. In this survey, we review works that have contributed to this perspective
  and demonstrate the close theoretical connections between predictive coding and
  backpropagation, as well as works that highlight the multiple advantages of using
  predictive coding models over backpropagation-trained neural networks. Specifically,
  we show the substantially greater flexibility of predictive coding networks against
  equivalent deep neural networks, which can function as classifiers, generators,
  and associative memories simultaneously, and can be defined on arbitrary graph topologies.
  Finally, we review direct benchmarks of predictive coding networks on machine learning
  classification tasks, as well as its close connections to control theory and applications
  in robotics.
