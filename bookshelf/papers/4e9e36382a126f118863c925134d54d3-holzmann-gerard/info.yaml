abstract: The SPIN Model Checker is used for both teaching software verification techniques,
  and for validating large scale applications. The growing number of users has created
  a need for a more comprehensive user guide and a standard reference manual that
  describes the most recent version of the tool. This book fills that need. SPIN is
  used in over 40 countries. The offical SPIN web site, spinroot.com receives between
  2500 and 3000 hits per day. It has been estimated that up to three-quarters of the  billion
  spent annually to hire programmers in the United States is ultimately spent on debugging
