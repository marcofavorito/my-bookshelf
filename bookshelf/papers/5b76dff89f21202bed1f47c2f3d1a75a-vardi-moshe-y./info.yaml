abstract: 'Reasoning about multi-agents systems at the <i>knowledge level</i> allows
  us to abstract away from many concrete details of the systems we are considering.
  Fagin et al. introduced two notions to facilitate designing and reasoning about
  systems in terms of knowledge. The first notion is that of <i>knowledge-based programs.</i>
  Knowledge-based programs are defined as syntactic objects: programs with tests for
  knowledge. The second notion is that of <i>contexts</i>, which capture the setting
  in which a program is to be executed. In a given context, a standard program (one
  without tests for knowledge) is always <i>implementable.</i> A knowledge-based program,
  on the other hand, might not be implementable. We provide a condition which is necessary
  and sufficient to guarantee that a given knowledge-based program is implemented
  by a given protocol, and we completely characterize the complexity of determining
  whether a given knowledge-based program is implemented by a given protocol in a
  given <i>finite-state</i> context. In particular, we identify an important special
  case where this problem is tractable.'
