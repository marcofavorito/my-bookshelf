abstract: 'To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like
  artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need
  to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons
  between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years,
  there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across
  both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions
  and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions
  of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the
  contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by
  comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board
  games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls
  short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge
  and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters
  to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system''s
  own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence
  based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition
  efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors,
  and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a
  general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following
  these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit
  set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue
  that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence
  and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and
  humans.'
