abstract: Self-supervised learning, dubbed the dark matter of intelligence, is a promising
  path to advance machine learning. Yet, much like cooking, training SSL methods is
  a delicate art with a high barrier to entry. While many components are familiar,
  successfully training a SSL method involves a dizzying set of choices from the pretext
  tasks to training hyper-parameters. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry into
  SSL research by laying the foundations and latest SSL recipes in the style of a
  cookbook. We hope to empower the curious researcher to navigate the terrain of methods,
  understand the role of the various knobs, and gain the know-how required to explore
  how delicious SSL can be.
