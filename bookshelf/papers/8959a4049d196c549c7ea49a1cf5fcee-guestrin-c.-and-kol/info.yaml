abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning under uncertainty in large
  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Factored MDPs represent a complex state space
  using state variables and the transition model using a dynamic Bayesian network.
  This representation often allows an exponential reduction in the representation
  size of structured MDPs, but the complexity of exact solution algorithms for such
  MDPs can grow exponentially in the representation size. In this paper, we present
  two approximate solution algorithms that exploit structure in factored MDPs. Both
  use an approximate value function represented as a linear combination of basis functions,
  where each basis function involves only a small subset of the domain variables.
  A key contribution of this paper is that it shows how the basic operations of both
  algorithms can be performed efficiently in closed form, by exploiting both additive
  and context-specific structure in a factored MDP. A central element of our algorithms
  is a novel linear program decomposition technique, analogous to variable elimination
  in Bayesian networks, which reduces an exponentially large LP to a provably equivalent,
  polynomial-sized one. One algorithm uses approximate linear programming, and the
  second approximate dynamic programming. Our dynamic programming algorithm is novel
  in that it uses an approximation based on max-norm, a technique that more directly
  minimizes the terms that appear in error bounds for approximate MDP algorithms.
  We provide experimental results on problems with over 10^40 states, demonstrating
  a promising indication of the scalability of our approach, and compare our algorithm
  to an existing state-of-the-art approach, showing, in some problems, exponential
  gains in computation time.
