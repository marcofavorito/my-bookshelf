abstract: Deep neural networks are a family of computational models that are naturally
  suited to the analysis of hierarchical data such as, for instance, sequential data
  with the use of recurrent neural networks. In the other hand, ordinal regression
  is a well-known predictive modelling problem used in fields as diverse as psychometry
  to deep neural network based voice modelling. Their specificity lies in the properties
  of their outcome variable, typically considered as a categorical variable with natural
  ordering properties, typically allowing comparisons between different states ("a
  little" is less than "somewhat" which is itself less than "a lot", with transitivity
  allowed). This article investigates the application of sequence-to-sequence learning
  methods provided by the deep learning framework in ordinal regression, by formulating
  the ordinal regression problem as a sequential binary search. A method for visualizing
  the model's explanatory variables according to the ordinal target variable is proposed,
  that bears some similarities to linear discriminant analysis. The method is compared
  to traditional ordinal regression methods on a number of benchmark dataset, and
  is shown to have comparable or significantly better predictive power.
