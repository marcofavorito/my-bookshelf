abstract: A key element in solving real-life data science problems is selecting the
  types of models to use. Tree ensemble models (such as XGBoost) are usually recommended
  for classification and regression problems with tabular data. However, several deep
  learning models for tabular data have recently been proposed, claiming to outperform
  XGBoost for some use cases. This paper explores whether these deep models should
  be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models
  to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance,
  we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost
  outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in
  the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires
  much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models
  and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.
