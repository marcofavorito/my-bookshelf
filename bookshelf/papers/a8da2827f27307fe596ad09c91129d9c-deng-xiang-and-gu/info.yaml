abstract: 'We introduce Mind2Web, the first dataset for developing and evaluating
  generalist agents for the web that can follow language instructions to complete
  complex tasks on any website. Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated
  websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for
  generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites
  spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, Mind2Web provides
  three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diverse domains,
  websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulated and simplified
  ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we
  conduct an initial exploration of using large language models (LLMs) for building
  generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large
  to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a small LM significantly
  improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent
  level of performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen
  before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly generalizable
  agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web)
  to facilitate further research on building a generalist agent for the web.'
