abstract: This work presents MLIR, a novel approach to building reusable and extensible
  compiler infrastructure. MLIR aims to address software fragmentation, improve compilation
  for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific
  compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers together. MLIR facilitates the
  design and implementation of code generators, translators and optimizers at different
  levels of abstraction and also across application domains, hardware targets and
  execution environments. The contribution of this work includes (1) discussion of
  MLIR as a research artifact, built for extension and evolution, and identifying
  the challenges and opportunities posed by this novel design point in design, semantics,
  optimization specification, system, and engineering. (2) evaluation of MLIR as a
  generalized infrastructure that reduces the cost of building compilers-describing
  diverse use-cases to show research and educational opportunities for future programming
  languages, compilers, execution environments, and computer architecture. The paper
  also presents the rationale for MLIR, its original design principles, structures
  and semantics.
