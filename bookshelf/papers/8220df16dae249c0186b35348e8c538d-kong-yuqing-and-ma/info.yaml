abstract: In future, information may become one of the most important assets in economy.
  However, unlike common goods (e.g. clothing), information is troublesome in trading
  since the information commodities are \emph{vulnerable}, as they lose their values
  immediately after revelation, and possibly unverifiable, as they can be subjective.
  By authorizing a trusted center (e.g. Amazon) to help manage the information trade,
  traders are ``forced'' to give the trusted center the ability to become an information
  monopolist.   To this end, we need a trust-free (i.e. without a trusted center and
  with only strategic traders) unverifiable information trade protocol such that it
  1) motivates the sellers to provide high quality information, and the buyer to pay
  for the information with a fair price (truthful); 2) except the owner, the information
  is known only to its buyer if the trade is executed (secure).   In an unverifiable
  information trade scenario (e.g. a medical company wants to buy experts' opinions
  on multiple difficult medical images with unknown pathological truth from several
  hospitals), we design a trust-free, truthful, and secure protocol, Smart Info-Dealer
  (SMind), for information trading, by borrowing three cutting-edge tools that include
  peer prediction, secure multi-party computation, and smart contract. With SMind,
  without a trusted center, a seller with high-quality information is able to sell
  her information securely at a fair price and those with low-quality information
  cannot earn extra money with poor information or steal information from other sellers.
  We believe SMind will help describe a free and secure information trade scenario
  in the future.
