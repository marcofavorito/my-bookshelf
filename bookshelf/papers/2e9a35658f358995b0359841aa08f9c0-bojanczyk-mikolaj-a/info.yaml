abstract: 'We define a new class of languages of $\omega$-words, strictly extending
  $\omega$-regular languages.   One way to present this new class is by a type of
  regular expressions. The new expressions are an extension of $\omega$-regular expressions
  where two new variants of the Kleene star $L^*$ are added: $L^B$ and $L^S$. These
  new exponents are used to say that parts of the input word have bounded size, and
  that parts of the input can have arbitrarily large sizes, respectively. For instance,
  the expression $(a^Bb)^\omega$ represents the language of infinite words over the
  letters $a,b$ where there is a common bound on the number of consecutive letters
  $a$. The expression $(a^Sb)^\omega$ represents a similar language, but this time
  the distance between consecutive $b$''s is required to tend toward the infinite.   We
  develop a theory for these languages, with a focus on decidability and closure.
  We define an equivalent automaton model, extending B\"uchi automata. The main technical
  result is a complementation lemma that works for languages where only one type of
  exponent---either $L^B$ or $L^S$---is used.   We use the closure and decidability
  results to obtain partial decidability results for the logic MSOLB, a logic obtained
  by extending monadic second-order logic with new quantifiers that speak about the
  size of sets.'
