abstract: This is a book of arbitrages available in option, futures, bond, foreign
  exchange, and commodity markets. An arbitrage is money earned from the market without
  risk or investment. Financial institutions earn this 'free money' every day, and
  while not easy, investors can also attempt to do so. Understanding these arbitrages
  also affords the reader an understanding of how financial markets work. Lastly each
  arbitrage is like a puzzle, and thus interesting to anyone searching for a set of
  brain-teasers.
