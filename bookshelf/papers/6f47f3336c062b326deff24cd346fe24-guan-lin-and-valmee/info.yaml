abstract: 'There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models
  (LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as planners
  are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited correctness
  of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with simulators or even
  the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing human feedback. In this
  work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that constructs an explicit world
  (domain) model in planning domain definition language (PDDL) and then uses it to
  plan with sound domain-independent planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not
  generate a fully functional PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface
  between PDDL and sources of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans.
  For users who lack a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into
  natural language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying
  domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered by
  the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users to correct
  domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and correcting (through interactive
  prompting) every generated plan as in previous work. On two IPC domains and a Household
  domain that is more complicated than commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld,
  we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for
  over 40 actions, and the corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve
  48 challenging planning tasks. Resources, including the source code, are released
