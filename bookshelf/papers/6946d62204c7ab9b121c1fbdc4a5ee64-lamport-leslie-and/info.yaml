abstract: "From late fall 1996 through early summer 1997, Mark Tuttle, Yuan Yu, and\
  \ I worked on the specification and verification of the cache-coherence protocol\
  \ for a computer code-named Wildfire.  We worked closely with Madhu Sharma, one\
  \ of Wildfire's designers.  We wrote a detailed specification of the protocol as\
  \ well as a specification of the memory model that it was supposed to implement.\
  \  We then proved various properties, but did not attempt a complete proof.  In\
  \ early 2000, Madhu, Mark, and I wrote a specification of a higher-level abstract\
  \ version of the protocol.  \n\nThere was one detail of the protocol that struck\
  \ me as particularly subtle.  I had the idea of publishing an incorrect version\
  \ of the specification with that detail omitted as a challenge problem for the verification\
  \ community.  I did that and put it on the Web in June, 2000.  To further disseminate\
  \ the problem, we wrote this description of it for the CAV (Computer Aided Verification)\
  \ conference."
