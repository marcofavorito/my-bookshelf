abstract: The existence of simple, uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to correlated
  equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory of multi-agent
  systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years that when all players
  seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated normal-form game, the empirical
  frequency of play converges to a normal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form
  (that is, tree-form) games generalize normal-form games by modeling both sequential
  and simultaneous moves, as well as private information. Because of the sequential
  nature and presence of partial information in the game, extensive-form correlation
  has significantly different properties than the normal-form counterpart, many of
  which are still open research directions. Extensive-form correlated equilibrium
  (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart to normal-form
  correlated equilibrium. However, it was currently unknown whether EFCE emerges as
  the result of uncoupled agent dynamics. In this paper, we give the first uncoupled
  no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in $n$-player general-sum extensive-form
  games with perfect recall. First, we introduce a notion of trigger regret in extensive-form
  games, which extends that of internal regret in normal-form games. When each player
  has low trigger regret, the empirical frequency of play is close to an EFCE. Then,
  we give an efficient no-trigger-regret algorithm. Our algorithm decomposes trigger
  regret into local subproblems at each decision point for the player, and constructs
  a global strategy of the player from the local solutions at each decision point.
