abstract: This famous little book was first published in German in 1933 and in Russian
  a few years later, setting forth the axiomatic foundations of modern probability
  theory and cementing the author's reputation as a leading authority in the field.
  The distinguished Russian mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov wrote this foundational
  text, and it remains important both to students beginning a serious study of the
  topic and to historians of modern mathematics.Suitable as a text for advanced undergraduates
  and graduate students in mathematics, the treatment begins with an introduction
  to the elementary theory of probability and infinite probability fields. Subsequent
  chapters explore random variables, mathematical expectations, and conditional probabilities
  and mathematical expectations. The book concludes with a chapter on the law of large
  numbers, an Appendix on zero-or-one in the theory of probability, and detailed bibliographies.
