abstract: Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
  complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central nervous
  system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most delicately, the human
  brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized to uncover structure and
  organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features inherent to external stimuli
  onto different areas of the neocortex. considering the growth in size and complexity
  of state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth
  in complexity of the tasks that are tackled by these networks, the question arises
  whether ablation studies may be used to investigate these networks for a similar
  organization of their inner representations. In this paper, we address this question
  and performed two ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate
  their inner representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer
  vision domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure
  of the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network. Furthermore,
  some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network a certain robustness
  to structural damages. We further determined the importance of specific parts of
  the network for the classification task solely based on the weight structure of
  single units. Finally, we examined the ability of damaged networks to recover from
  the consequences of ablations by means of recovery training. We argue that ablations
  studies are a feasible method to investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and
  are especially helpful to examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a
  feature of ANNs that will become increasingly important for future safety-critical
  applications.
