abstract: We initiate the study of computing (near-)optimal contracts in succinctly
  representable principal-agent settings. Here optimality means maximizing the principal's
  expected payoff over all incentive-compatible contracts---known in economics as
  "second-best" solutions. We also study a natural relaxation to approximately incentive-compatible
  contracts.   We focus on principal-agent settings with succinctly described (and
  exponentially large) outcome spaces. We show that the computational complexity of
  computing a near-optimal contract depends fundamentally on the number of agent actions.
  For settings with a constant number of actions, we present a fully polynomial-time
  approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the separation oracle of the dual of the problem
  of minimizing the principal's payment to the agent, and use this subroutine to efficiently
  compute a delta-incentive-compatible (delta-IC) contract whose expected payoff matches
  or surpasses that of the optimal IC contract.   With an arbitrary number of actions,
  we prove that the problem is hard to approximate within any constant c. This inapproximability
  result holds even for delta-IC contracts where delta is a sufficiently rapidly-decaying
  function of c. On the positive side, we show that simple linear delta-IC contracts
  with constant delta are sufficient to achieve a constant-factor approximation of
  the "first-best" (full-welfare-extracting) solution, and that such a contract can
  be computed in polynomial time.
