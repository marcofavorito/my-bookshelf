abstract: This paper presents a survey on multi-agent platforms, with a particular
  focus on methodology. It presents the four stages of the construction of a multi-agent
  system and derives from these stages several criteria for comparison. These criteria
  are then used to evaluate four selected platforms, and lead to a discussion on the
  future of multiagent platforms.
