abstract: Higher-order recursion schemes are an expressive formalism used to define
  languages of possibly infinite ranked trees. They extend regular and context-free
  grammars, and are equivalent to simply typed $\lambda Y$-calculus and collapsible
  pushdown automata. In this work we prove, under a syntactical constraint called
  safety, decidability of the model-checking problem for recursion schemes against
  properties defined by alternating B-automata, an extension of alternating parity
  automata for infinite trees with a boundedness acceptance condition. We then exploit
  this result to show how to compute downward closures of languages of finite trees
  recognized by safe recursion schemes.
