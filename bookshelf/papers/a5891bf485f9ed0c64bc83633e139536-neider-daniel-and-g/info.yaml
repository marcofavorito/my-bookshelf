abstract: We present two novel algorithms for learning formulas in Linear Temporal
  Logic (LTL) from examples. The first learning algorithm reduces the learning task
  to a series of satisfiability problems in propositional Boolean logic and produces
  a smallest LTL formula (in terms of the number of subformulas) that is consistent
  with the given data. Our second learning algorithm, on the other hand, combines
  the SAT-based learning algorithm with classical algorithms for learning decision
  trees. The result is a learning algorithm that scales to real-world scenarios with
  hundreds of examples, but can no longer guarantee to produce minimal consistent
  LTL formulas. We compare both learning algorithms and demonstrate their performance
  on a wide range of synthetic benchmarks. Additionally, we illustrate their usefulness
  on the task of understanding executions of a leader election protocol.
