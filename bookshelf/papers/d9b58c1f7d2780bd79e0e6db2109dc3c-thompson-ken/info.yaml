abstract: <jats:p>A method for locating specific character strings embedded in character
  text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler
  is discussed. The compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces
  an IBM 7094 program as object language. The object program then accepts the text
  to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the
  text matches the given regular expression. Examples, problems, and solutions are
  also presented.</jats:p>
