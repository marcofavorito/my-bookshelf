abstract: <jats:p>Complexity theory is a central field of the theoretical foundations
  of computer science. It is concerned with the general study of the intrinsic complexity
  of computational tasks; that is, it addresses the question of what can be achieved
  within limited time (and/or with other limited natural computational resources).
  This book offers a conceptual perspective on complexity theory. It is intended to
  serve as an introduction for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, either
  as a textbook or for self-study. The book will also be useful to experts, since
  it provides expositions of the various sub-areas of complexity theory such as hardness
  amplification, pseudorandomness and probabilistic proof systems. In each case, the
  author starts by posing the intuitive questions that are addressed by the sub-area
  and then discusses the choices made in the actual formulation of these questions,
  the approaches that lead to the answers, and the ideas that are embedded in these
  answers.</jats:p>
