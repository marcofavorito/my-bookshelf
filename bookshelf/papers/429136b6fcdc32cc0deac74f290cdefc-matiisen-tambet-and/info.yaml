abstract: 'We propose Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning (TSCL), a framework for
  automatic curriculum learning, where the Student tries to learn a complex task and
  the Teacher automatically chooses subtasks from a given set for the Student to train
  on. We describe a family of Teacher algorithms that rely on the intuition that the
  Student should practice more those tasks on which it makes the fastest progress,
  i.e. where the slope of the learning curve is highest. In addition, the Teacher
  algorithms address the problem of forgetting by also choosing tasks where the Student''s
  performance is getting worse. We demonstrate that TSCL matches or surpasses the
  results of carefully hand-crafted curricula in two tasks: addition of decimal numbers
  with LSTM and navigation in Minecraft. Using our automatically generated curriculum
  enabled to solve a Minecraft maze that could not be solved at all when training
  directly on solving the maze, and the learning was an order of magnitude faster
  than uniform sampling of subtasks.'
