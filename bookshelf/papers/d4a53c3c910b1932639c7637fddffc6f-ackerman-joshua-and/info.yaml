abstract: This report is a survey of the relationships between various state-of-the-art
  neural network architectures and formal languages as, for example, structured by
  the Chomsky Language Hierarchy. Of particular interest are the abilities of a neural
  architecture to represent, recognize and generate words from a specific language
  by learning from samples of the language.
