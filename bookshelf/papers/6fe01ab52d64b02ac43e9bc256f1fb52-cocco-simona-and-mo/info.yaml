abstract: This document presents the material of two lectures on statistical physics
  and neural representations, delivered by one of us (R.M.) at the Fundamental Problems
  in Statistical Physics XIV summer school in July 2017. In a first part, we consider
  the neural representations of space (maps) in the hippocampus. We introduce an extension
  of the Hopfield model, able to store multiple spatial maps as continuous, finite-dimensional
  attractors. The phase diagram and dynamical properties of the model are analyzed.
  We then show how spatial representations can be dynamically decoded using an effective
  Ising model capturing the correlation structure in the neural data, and compare
  applications to data obtained from hippocampal multi-electrode recordings and by
  (sub)sampling our attractor model. In a second part, we focus on the problem of
  learning data representations in machine learning, in particular with artificial
  neural networks. We start by introducing data representations through some illustrations.
  We then analyze two important algorithms, Principal Component Analysis and Restricted
  Boltzmann Machines, with tools from statistical physics.
