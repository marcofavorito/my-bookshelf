abstract: In this paper we reexamine the place and role of stable model semantics
  in logic programming and contrast it with a least Herbrand model approach to Horn
  programs. We demonstrate that inherent features of stable model semantics naturally
  lead to a logic programming system that offers an interesting alternative to more
  traditional logic programming styles of Horn logic programming, stratified logic
  programming and logic programming with well-founded semantics. The proposed approach
  is based on the interpretation of program clauses as constraints. In this setting
  programs do not describe a single intended model, but a family of stable models.
  These stable models encode solutions to the constraint satisfaction problem described
  by the program. Our approach imposes restrictions on the syntax of logic programs.
  In particular, function symbols are eliminated from the language. We argue that
  the resulting logic programming system is well-attuned to problems in the class
  NP, has a well-defined domain of applications, and an emerging methodology of programming.
  We point out that what makes the whole approach viable is recent progress in implementations
  of algorithms to compute stable models of propositional logic programs.
