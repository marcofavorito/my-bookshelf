abstract: 'The spectral gap - the energy difference between the ground state and first
  excited state - is central to quantum many-body physics. Many challenging open problems,
  such as the Haldane conjecture, existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases,
  or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems
  are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: given a quantum many-body
  Hamiltonian, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable
  problem. We construct families of quantum spin systems on a 2D lattice with translationally-invariant,
  nearest-neighbour interactions for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable.
  This result extends to undecidability of other low energy properties, such as existence
  of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines Hamiltonian
  complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a Hamiltonian whose ground
  state encodes the evolution of a quantum phase-estimation algorithm followed by
  a universal Turing Machine. The spectral gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding
  Halting Problem. Our result implies that there exists no algorithm to determine
  whether an arbitrary model is gapped or gapless. It also implies that there exist
  models for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the
  axioms of mathematics.'
