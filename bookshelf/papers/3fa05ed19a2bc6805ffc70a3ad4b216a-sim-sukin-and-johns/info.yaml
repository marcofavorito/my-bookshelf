abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance
  of many variational hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) algorithms. One challenge in
  implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents
  the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters.
  To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we
  propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling
  capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized
  quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures,
  varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we
  identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In
  particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit
  gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on
  a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling
  capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences
  of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates"
  with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to
  be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the
  correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be
  investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm
  development and design of experiments for general variational HQC algorithms.
