abstract: By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application
  of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis
  results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding
  mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since
  these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful
  DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential
  evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining
  their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained
  autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a
  representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity
  reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing
  cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into
  powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or
  bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional
  manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image
  inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional
  image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly
  reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available
