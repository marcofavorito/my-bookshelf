abstract: The reward hypothesis posits that, "all of what we mean by goals and purposes
  can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum
  of a received scalar signal (reward)." We aim to fully settle this hypothesis. This
  will not conclude with a simple affirmation or refutation, but rather specify completely
  the implicit requirements on goals and purposes under which the hypothesis holds.
