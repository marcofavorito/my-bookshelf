abstract: In this paper, we derive a generalization of the Speedy Q-learning (SQL)
  algorithm that was proposed in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature to handle
  slow convergence of Watkins' Q-learning. In most RL algorithms such as Q-learning,
  the Bellman equation and the Bellman operator play an important role. It is possible
  to generalize the Bellman operator using the technique of successive relaxation.
  We use the generalized Bellman operator to derive a simple and efficient family
  of algorithms called Generalized Speedy Q-learning (GSQL-w) and analyze its finite
  time performance. We show that GSQL-w has an improved finite time performance bound
  compared to SQL for the case when the relaxation parameter w is greater than 1.
  This improvement is a consequence of the contraction factor of the generalized Bellman
  operator being less than that of the standard Bellman operator. Numerical experiments
  are provided to demonstrate the empirical performance of the GSQL-w algorithm.
