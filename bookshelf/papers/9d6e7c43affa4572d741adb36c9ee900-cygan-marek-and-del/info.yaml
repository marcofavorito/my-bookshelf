abstract: The field of exact exponential time algorithms for NP-hard problems has
  thrived over the last decade. While exhaustive search remains asymptotically the
  fastest known algorithm for some basic problems, difficult and non-trivial exponential
  time algorithms have been found for a myriad of problems, including Graph Coloring,
  Hamiltonian Path, Dominating Set and 3-CNF-Sat. In some instances, improving these
  algorithms further seems to be out of reach. The CNF-Sat problem is the canonical
  example of a problem for which the trivial exhaustive search algorithm runs in time
  O(2^n), where n is the number of variables in the input formula. While there exist
  non-trivial algorithms for CNF-Sat that run in time o(2^n), no algorithm was able
  to improve the growth rate 2 to a smaller constant, and hence it is natural to conjecture
  that 2 is the optimal growth rate. The strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH)
  by Impagliazzo and Paturi [JCSS 2001] goes a little bit further and asserts that,
  for every epsilon<1, there is a (large) integer k such that that k-CNF-Sat cannot
  be computed in time 2^{epsilon n}.   In this paper, we show that, for every epsilon
  < 1, the problems Hitting Set, Set Splitting, and NAE-Sat cannot be computed in
  time O(2^{epsilon n}) unless SETH fails. Here n is the number of elements or variables
  in the input. For these problems, we actually get an equivalence to SETH in a certain
  sense. We conjecture that SETH implies a similar statement for Set Cover, and prove
  that, under this assumption, the fastest known algorithms for Steinter Tree, Connected
  Vertex Cover, Set Partitioning, and the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for Subset
  Sum cannot be significantly improved. Finally, we justify our assumption about the
  hardness of Set Cover by showing that the parity of the number of set covers cannot
  be computed in time O(2^{epsilon n}) for any epsilon<1 unless SETH fails.
