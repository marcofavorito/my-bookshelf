abstract: Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence -- the combination of symbolic methods
  with methods that are based on artificial neural networks -- has a long-standing
  history. In this article, we provide a structured overview of current trends, by
  means of categorizing recent publications from key conferences. The article is meant
  to serve as a convenient starting point for research on the general topic.
