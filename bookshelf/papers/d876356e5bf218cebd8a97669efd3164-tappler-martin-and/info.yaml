abstract: 'Automata learning techniques automatically generate system models from
  test observations. These techniques usually fall into two categories: passive and
  active. Passive learning uses a predetermined data set, e.g., system logs. In contrast,
  active learning actively queries the system under learning, which is considered
  more efficient.   An influential active learning technique is Angluin''s L* algorithm
  for regular languages which inspired several generalisations from DFAs to other
  automata-based modelling formalisms. In this work, we study L*-based learning of
  deterministic Markov decision processes, first assuming an ideal setting with perfect
  information. Then, we relax this assumption and present a novel learning algorithm
  that collects information by sampling system traces via testing. Experiments with
  the implementation of our sampling-based algorithm suggest that it achieves better
  accuracy than state-of-the-art passive learning techniques with the same amount
  of test data. Unlike existing learning algorithms with predefined states, our algorithm
  learns the complete model structure including the states.'
