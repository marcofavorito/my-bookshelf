abstract: Boolean functional synthesis is the process of constructing a Boolean function
  from a Boolean specification that relates input and output variables. Despite significant
  recent developments in synthesis algorithms, Boolean functional synthesis remains
  a challenging problem even when state-of-the-art methods are used for decomposing
  the specification. In this work we bring a fresh decomposition approach, orthogonal
  to existing methods, that explores the decomposition of the specification into separate
  input and output components. We make use of an input-output decomposition of a given
  specification described as a CNF formula, by alternatingly analyzing the separate
  input and output components. We exploit well-defined properties of these components
  to ultimately synthesize a solution for the entire specification. We first provide
  a theoretical result that, for input components with specific structures, synthesis
  for CNF formulas via this framework can be performed more efficiently than in the
  general case. We then show by experimental evaluations that our algorithm performs
  well also in practice on instances which are challenging for existing state-of-the-art
  tools, serving as a good complement to modern synthesis techniques.
