abstract: This paper presents Mir-BFT, a robust Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) total
  order broadcast protocol aimed at maximizing throughput on wide-area networks (WANs),
  targeting deployments in decentralized networks, such as permissioned and Proof-of-Stake
  permissionless blockchain systems.   Mir-BFT is the first BFT protocol that allows
  multiple leaders to propose request batches independently (i.e., parallel leaders),
  in a way that precludes request duplication attacks by malicious (Byzantine) clients,
  by rotating the assignment of a partitioned request hash space to leaders.   As
  this mechanism removes a single-leader bandwidth bottleneck and exposes a computation
  bottleneck related to authenticating clients even on a WAN, our protocol further
  boosts throughput using a client signature verification sharding optimization.   Our
  evaluation shows that Mir-BFT outperforms state-of-the-art and orders more than
  60000 signed Bitcoin-sized (500-byte) transactions per second on a widely distributed
  100 nodes, 1 Gbps WAN setup, with typical latencies of few seconds.   We also evaluate
  Mir-BFT under different crash and Byzantine faults, demonstrating its performance
  robustness.   Mir-BFT relies on classical BFT protocol constructs, which simplifies
  reasoning about its correctness.   Specifically, Mir-BFT is a generalization of
  the celebrated and scrutinized PBFT protocol. In a nutshell, Mir-BFT follows PBFT
  "safety-wise", with changes needed to accommodate novel features restricted to PBFT
  liveness.
