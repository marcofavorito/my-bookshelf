abstract: Generative AI has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, leading
  to a wide array of applications across diverse domains. In this paper, we present
  a comprehensive survey of more than 350 generative AI applications, providing a
  structured taxonomy and concise descriptions of various unimodal and even multimodal
  generative AIs. The survey is organized into sections, covering a wide range of
  unimodal generative AI applications such as text, images, video, gaming and brain
  information. Our survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and
  practitioners to navigate the rapidly expanding landscape of generative AI, facilitating
  a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art and fostering further innovation
  in the field.
