abstract: A web service is modeled here as a finite state machine. A composition problem
  for web services is to decide if a given web service can be constructed from a given
  set of web services; where the construction is understood as a simulation of the
  specification by a fully asynchronous product of the given services. We show an
  EXPTIME-lower bound for this problem, thus matching the known upper bound. Our result
  also applies to richer models of web services, such as the Roman model.
