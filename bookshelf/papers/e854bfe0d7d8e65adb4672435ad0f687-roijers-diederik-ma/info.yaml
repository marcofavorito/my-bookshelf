abstract: Sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives arise naturally
  in practice and pose unique challenges for research in decision-theoretic planning
  and learning, which has largely focused on single-objective settings. This article
  surveys algorithms designed for sequential decision-making problems with multiple
  objectives. Though there is a growing body of literature on this subject, little
  of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve
  multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identify three distinct scenarios in which
  converting such a problem to a single-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or
  undesirable. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective
  methods according to the applicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function
  (which projects multi-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies
  considered. We show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution,
  which can be a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy,
  we survey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning. Finally,
  we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future
  work.
