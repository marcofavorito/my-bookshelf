abstract: In a recent article, Luciano Floridi explains his view of Turing's legacy
  in connection to the philosophy of information. I will very briefly survey one of
  Turing's other contributions to the philosophy of information and computation, including
  similarities to Shannon's own methodological approach to information through communication,
  showing how crucial they are and have been as methodological strategies to understanding
  key aspects of these concepts. While Floridi's concept of Levels of Abstraction
  is related to the novel methodology of Turing's imitation game for tackling the
  question of machine intelligence, Turing's other main contribution to the philosophy
  of information runs contrary to it. Indeed, the seminal concept of computation universality
  strongly suggests the deletion of fundamental differences among seemingly different
  levels of description. How might we reconcile these apparently contradictory contributions?
  I will argue that Turing's contribution should prompt us to plot some directions
  for a philosophy of information and computation, one that closely parallels the
  most important developments in computer science, one that understands the profound
  implications of the works of Turing, Shannon and others.
