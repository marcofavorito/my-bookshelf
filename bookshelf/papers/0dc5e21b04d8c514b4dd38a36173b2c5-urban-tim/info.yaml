abstract: 'There''s a concerning trend happening in the modern world right now: we''re
  becoming more polarised, more tribal, worse at cooperating, and communicating. Or,
  said more succinctly, if modern society is like a human, that human seems to be
  getting younger and less mature each year that goes by. To make matters worse, any
  attempt at fixing our fractured society is labelled as radioactive. How did we get
  here, and why is it so hard to talk to each other about these issues?Tim Urban,
  the mind behind the popular blog Wait But Why, has spent years pondering this conundrum,
  and he''s come to believe that the problems we face today, and their underlying
  causes, aren''t actually that mysterious. The problem is that the language we use
  to talk about society is outdated and loaded with polarising baggage - if we can''t
  think and talk clearly about our minds, our communities, and our societies, then
  we can''t solve our problems. In The Story of Us, Urban forges a way through this
  impasse via a bold new language - full of new terms, enlightening graphs, and hilarious
  comics - that can help us think and talk better about who we are and what ails us.A
  masterclass in scientific clarity and humour, The Story of Us helps untangle our
  tribal, Us versus Them instincts from those that encourage us to be more collaborative
  and open-minded, offering tools for a more peaceful future.'
