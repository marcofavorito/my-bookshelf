abstract: Gödel’s two incompleteness theorems are among the mostimportant results
  in modern logic, and have deep implications forvarious issues. They concern the
  limits of provability in formalaxiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem
  states that inany consistent formal system {\textbackslash}(F{\textbackslash}) within
  which a certain amount ofarithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of
  the language of{\textbackslash}(F{\textbackslash}) which can neither be proved nor
  disproved in {\textbackslash}(F{\textbackslash}).According to the second incompleteness
  theorem, such a formal systemcannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming
  it isindeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on thephilosophy
  of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to applythe results also in other
  areas of philosophy such as the philosophyof mind, but these attempted applications
  are more controversial. Thepresent entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems
  and variousissues surrounding them. (See also the entry on Kurt Gödel for a discussion
  of the incompleteness theorems that contextualizesthem within a broader discussion
  of his mathematical and philosophicalwork.)
