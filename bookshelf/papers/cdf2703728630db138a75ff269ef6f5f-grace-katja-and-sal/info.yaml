abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping
  transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy,
  we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large
  survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers
  predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such
  as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving
  a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049),
  and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of
  AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs
  in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North
  Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers
  about anticipating and managing trends in AI.
