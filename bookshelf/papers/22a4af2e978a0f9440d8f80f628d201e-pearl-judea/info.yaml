abstract: Current machine learning systems operate, almost exclusively, in a statistical,
  or model-free mode, which entails severe theoretical limits on their power and performance.
  Such systems cannot reason about interventions and retrospection and, therefore,
  cannot serve as the basis for strong AI. To achieve human level intelligence, learning
  machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal
  inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present
  a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems
  and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal modeling.
