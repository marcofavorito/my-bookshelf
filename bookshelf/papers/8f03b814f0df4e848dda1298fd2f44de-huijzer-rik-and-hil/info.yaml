abstract: <p>Neural networks can approximate any function given sufficiently many
  hidden units, which implies that they, in theory, can approximate human behavior.
  Recently, natural language processing has advanced rapidly due to increases in the
  amount of hidden units and in the size of the datasets. With these advances in natural
  language capabilities, we wondered whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models
  show human behavior. In this article, we demonstrate that these models show language
  comprehension and communication skills to solve problems, which are considered to
  be key features of human behavior. Moreover, the process by which such AI-based
  models encode information leads to errors which are also common in humans, such
  as being vulnerable to misleading questions, source amnesia, and being sensitive
  to small changes in wording. Given the similarities with human behavior, we discuss
  the potential applications of LLMs in social science research.We conclude that LLMs
  and their close alignment with human behavior may provide a valuable source of information
  that can be studied to gain a better understanding of human behavior.</p>
