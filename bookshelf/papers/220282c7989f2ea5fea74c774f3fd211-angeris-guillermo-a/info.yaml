abstract: Liquidity and trading activity on constant function market makers (CFMMs)
  such as Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer has grown significantly in the second half
  of 2020. Much of the growth of these protocols has been driven by incentivized pools
  or 'yield farming', which reward participants in crypto assets for providing liquidity
  to CFMMs. As a result, CFMMs and associated protocols, which were historically very
  small markets, now constitute the most liquid trading venues for a large number
  of crypto assets. But what does it mean for a CFMM to be the most liquid market?
  In this paper, we propose a basic definition of price sensitivity and liquidity.
  We show that this definition is tightly related to the curvature of a CFMM's trading
  function and can be used to explain a number of heuristic results. For example,
  we show that low-curvature markets are good for coins whose market value is approximately
  fixed and that high-curvature markets are better for liquidity providers when traders
  have an informational edge. Additionally, the results can also be used to model
  interacting markets and explain the rise of incentivized liquidity provision, also
  known as 'yield farming.'
