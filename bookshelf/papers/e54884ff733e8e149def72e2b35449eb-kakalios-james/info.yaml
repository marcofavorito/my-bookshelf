abstract: 'James Kakalios explores the scientific plausibility of the powers and feats
  of the most famous superheroes — and discovers that in many cases the comic writers
  got their science surprisingly right. Along the way he provides an engaging and
  witty commentary while introducing the lay reader to both classic and cutting-edge
  concepts in physics, including: What Superman’s strength can tell us about the Newtonian
  physics of force, mass, and acceleration How Iceman’s and Storm’s powers illustrate
  the principles of thermal dynamics The physics behind the death of Spider-Man’s
  girlfriend Gwen Stacy Why physics professors gone bad are the most dangerous evil
  geniuses!'
