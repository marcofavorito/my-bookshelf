abstract: ChatGPT is built on a large language model trained on an enormous corpus
  of human text to emulate human conversation. Despite lacking any explicit programming
  regarding the laws of physics, recent work has demonstrated that GPT-3.5 could pass
  an introductory physics course at some nominal level and register something close
  to a minimal understanding of Newtonian Mechanics on the Force Concept Inventory.
  This work replicates those results and also demonstrates that the latest version,
  GPT-4, has reached a much higher mark in the latter context. Indeed, its responses
  come quite close to perfectly demonstrating expert-level competence, with a few
  very notable exceptions and limitations. We briefly comment on the implications
  of this for the future of physics education and pedagogy.
