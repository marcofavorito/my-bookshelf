abstract: We study upper and lower bounds on the sample-complexity of learning near-optimal
  behaviour in finite-state discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). For the upper
  bound we make the assumption that each action leads to at most two possible next-states
  and prove a new bound for a UCRL-style algorithm on the number of time-steps when
  it is not Probably Approximately Correct (PAC). The new lower bound strengthens
  previous work by being both more general (it applies to all policies) and tighter.
  The upper and lower bounds match up to logarithmic factors.
