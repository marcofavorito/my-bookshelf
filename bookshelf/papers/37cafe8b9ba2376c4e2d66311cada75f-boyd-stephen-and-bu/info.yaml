abstract: We consider a basic model of multi-period trading, which can be used to
  evaluate the performance of a trading strategy. We describe a framework for single-period
  optimization, where the trades in each period are found by solving a convex optimization
  problem that trades off expected return, risk, transaction cost and holding cost
  such as the borrowing cost for shorting assets. We then describe a multi-period
  version of the trading method, where optimization is used to plan a sequence of
  trades, with only the first one executed, using estimates of future quantities that
  are unknown when the trades are chosen. The single-period method traces back to
  Markowitz; the multi-period methods trace back to model predictive control. Our
  contribution is to describe the single-period and multi-period methods in one simple
  framework, giving a clear description of the development and the approximations
  made. In this paper we do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm,
  the predictions or forecasts of future quantities. The methods we describe in this
  paper can be thought of as good ways to exploit predictions, no matter how they
  are made. We have also developed a companion open-source software library that implements
  many of the ideas and methods described in the paper.
