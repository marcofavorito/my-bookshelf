abstract: Gaussian process modeling is a standard tool for building emulators for
  computer experiments, which are usually used to study deterministic functions, for
  example, a solution to a given system of partial differential equations. This work
  investigates applying Gaussian process modeling to a deterministic function from
  prediction and uncertainty quantification perspectives, where the Gaussian process
  model is misspecified. Specifically, we consider the case where the underlying function
  is fixed and from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by some kernel function,
  and the same kernel function is used in the Gaussian process modeling as the correlation
  function for prediction and uncertainty quantification. While upper bounds and the
  optimal convergence rate of prediction in the Gaussian process modeling have been
  extensively studied in the literature, a comprehensive exploration of convergence
  rates and theoretical study of uncertainty quantification is lacking. We prove that,
  if one uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the variance in Gaussian process
  modeling, under different choices of the regularization parameter value, the predictor
  is not optimal and/or the confidence interval is not reliable. In particular, lower
  bounds of the prediction error under different choices of the regularization parameter
  value are obtained. The results indicate that, if one directly applies Gaussian
  process modeling to a fixed function, the reliability of the confidence interval
  and the optimality of the predictor cannot be achieved at the same time.
