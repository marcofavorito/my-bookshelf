abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great success in automating the
  design of neural networks, but the prohibitive amount of computations behind current
  NAS methods requires further investigations in improving the sample efficiency and
  the network evaluation cost to get better results in a shorter time. In this paper,
  we present a novel scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based NAS agent, named
  AlphaX, to tackle these two aspects. AlphaX improves the search efficiency by adaptively
  balancing the exploration and exploitation at the state level, and by a Meta-Deep
  Neural Network (DNN) to predict network accuracies for biasing the search toward
  a promising region. To amortize the network evaluation cost, AlphaX accelerates
  MCTS rollouts with a distributed design and reduces the number of epochs in evaluating
  a network by transfer learning guided with the tree structure in MCTS. In 12 GPU
  days and 1000 samples, AlphaX found an architecture that reaches 97.84\% top-1 accuracy
  on CIFAR-10, and 75.5\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, exceeding SOTA NAS methods in
  both the accuracy and sampling efficiency. Particularly, we also evaluate AlphaX
  on NASBench-101, a large scale NAS dataset; AlphaX is 3x and 2.8x more sample efficient
  than Random Search and Regularized Evolution in finding the global optimum. Finally,
  we show the searched architecture improves a variety of vision applications from
  Neural Style Transfer, to Image Captioning and Object Detection.
