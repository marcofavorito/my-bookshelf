abstract: '<jats:p>On June 4, 1925, Hilbert delivered an address to the Westphalian
  Mathematical Society in Miinster; that was, as a quick calculation will convince
  you, almost exactly sixty years ago. The address was published in 1926 under the
  title Über das <jats:italic>Unendliche</jats:italic> and is perhaps Hilbert''s most
  comprehensive presentation of his ideas concerning the finitist justification of
  classical mathematics and the role his proof theory was to play in it. But what
  has become of the ambitious program for securing all of mathematics, once and for
  all? What of proof theory, the very subject Hilbert invented to carry out his program?
  The Hilbertian ambition reached out too far: in its original form, the program was
  refuted by Gödel''s Incompleteness Theorems. And even allowing more than finitist
  means in metamathematics, the Hilbertian expectations for proof theory have not
  been realized: a constructive consistency proof for second-order arithmetic is still
  out of reach. (And since that theory provides a formal framework for analysis, it
  was considered by Hilbert and Bernays as decisive for proof theory.) Nevertheless,
  remarkable progress has been made. Two separate, but complementary directions of
  research have led to surprising insights: classical analysis can be formally developed
  in conservative extensions of elementary number theory; relative consistency proofs
  can be given by constructive means for impredicative parts of second order arithmetic.
  The mathematical and metamathematical developments have been accompanied by sustained
  philosophical reflections on the foundations of mathematics. This indicates briefly
  the main themes of the contributions to the symposium; in my introductory remarks
  I want to give a very schematic perspective, that is partly historical and partly
  systematic.</jats:p>'
