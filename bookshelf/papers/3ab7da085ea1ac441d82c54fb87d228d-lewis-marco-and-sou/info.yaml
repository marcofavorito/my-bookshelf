abstract: Over the past 27 years, quantum computing has seen a huge rise in interest
  from both academia and industry. At the current rate, quantum computers are growing
  in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field. Significant
  efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum hardware and to develop
  suitable software to program quantum computers. In contrast, the verification of
  quantum programs has received relatively less attention. Verifying programs is especially
  important in the quantum setting due to how difficult it is to program complex algorithms
  correctly on resource-constrained and error-prone quantum hardware. Research into
  creating verification frameworks for quantum programs has seen recent development,
  with a variety of tools implemented using a collection of theoretical ideas. This
  survey aims to be a short introduction into the area of formal verification of quantum
  programs, bringing together theory and tools developed to date. Further, this survey
  examines some of the challenges that the field may face in the future, namely the
  development of complex quantum algorithms.
