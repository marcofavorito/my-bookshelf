abstract: Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort
  in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader
  field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction
  by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches
  are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed
  in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous
  feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of
  nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving
  network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network
  neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores
  diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid
  notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring
  neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the
  efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification
  and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together,
  our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent
  representations in complex networks.
