abstract: The use of assertions in software development is thought to help produce
  quality software. Unfortunately, there is scant empirical evidence in commercial
  software systems for this argument to date. This paper presents an empirical case
  study of two commercial software components at Microsoft Corporation. The developers
  of these components systematically employed assertions, which allowed us to investigate
  the relationship between software assertions and code quality. We also compare the
  efficacy of assertions against that of popular bug finding techniques like source
  code static analysis tools. We observe from our case study that with an increase
  in the assertion density in a file there is a statistically significant decrease
  in fault density. Further, the usage of software assertions in these components
  found a large percentage of the faults in the bug database.
