abstract: 'The classical subset construction for non-deterministic automata can be
  generalized to other side-effects captured by a monad. The key insight is that both
  the state space of the determinized automaton and its semantics---languages over
  an alphabet---have a common algebraic structure: they are Eilenberg-Moore algebras
  for the powerset monad. In this paper we study the reverse question to determinization.
  We will present a construction to associate succinct automata to languages based
  on different algebraic structures. For instance, for classical regular languages
  the construction will transform a deterministic automaton into a non-deterministic
  one, where the states represent the join-irreducibles of the language accepted by
  a (potentially) larger deterministic automaton. Other examples will yield alternating
  automata, automata with symmetries, CABA-structured automata, and weighted automata.'
