abstract: 'During the 60s and 70s, AI researchers explored intuitions about intelligence
  by writing programs that displayed intelligent behavior. Many good ideas came out
  from this work but programs written by hand were not robust or general. After the
  80s, research increasingly shifted to the development of learners capable of inferring
  behavior and functions from experience and data, and solvers capable of tackling
  well-defined but intractable models like SAT, classical planning, Bayesian networks,
  and POMDPs. The learning approach has achieved considerable success but results
  in black boxes that do not have the flexibility, transparency, and generality of
  their model-based counterparts. Model-based approaches, on the other hand, require
  models and scalable algorithms. Model-free learners and model-based solvers have
  close parallels with Systems 1 and 2 in current theories of the human mind: the
  first, a fast, opaque, and inflexible intuitive mind; the second, a slow, transparent,
  and flexible analytical mind. In this paper, I review developments in AI and draw
  on these theories to discuss the gap between model-free learners and model-based
  solvers, a gap that needs to be bridged in order to have intelligent systems that
  are robust and general.'
