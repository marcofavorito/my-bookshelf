abstract: The C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) demonstrates the violation of assertions
  in C programs, or proves safety of the assertions under a given bound. CBMC implements
  a bit-precise translation of an input C program, annotated with assertions and with
  loops unrolled to a given depth, into a formula. If the formula is satisfiable,
  then an execution leading to a violated assertion exists. CBMC is one of the most
  successful software verification tools. Its main advantages are its precision, robustness
  and simplicity. CBMC is shipped as part of several Linux distributions. It has been
  used by thousands of software developers to verify real-world software, such as
  the Linux kernel, and powers commercial software analysis and test generation tools.
  Table 1 gives an overview of CBMC's features. CBMC is also a versatile tool that
  can be applied to solve many practical program analysis problems such as bug finding,
  property checking, test input generation, detection of security vulnerabilities,
  equivalence checking and program synthesis. This chapter will give an introduction
  into CBMC, including practical examples and pointers to further reading. Moreover,
  we give insights about the development of CBMC itself, showing how its performance
  evolved over the last decade.
