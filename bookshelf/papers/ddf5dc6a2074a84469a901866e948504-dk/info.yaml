abstract: A practical illustrated guide to exploring, observing, and understanding
  natureChris Packham will pass on his passion for nature and make you an enthusiastic
  and knowledgeable amateur naturalistChris Packham’s Nature Handbook reveals how
  easy it is to enjoy and learn about plants, animals, habitats, and ecological processes.
  It features visual studies of habitats – full of photos of the animals and plants
  that live there and illustrations of how they interact. All the habitats in your
  region (Europe in the UK edition, or North America in the US edition) are included,
  from accessible urban and farming landscapes to wilderness areas. This book reveals
  the sights, sounds, and smells you can encounter and shows you how to connect with
  nature without intruding. It provides illustrated guides to activities for every
  season. Many of these, like pond dipping and raising butterflies from caterpillars,
  can be done close to home and without expensive equipment. The book promotes conservation
  and demonstrates simple ways to contribute to the health of the natural world.First
  published in 2010, this edition has been extensively revised to present more local
  information relevant to the habitats where you live, and to include the latest equipment
  and conservation issues. A blend of inspirational guide, essential reference, and
  “how-to”, this book will make you wild about the natural world.
