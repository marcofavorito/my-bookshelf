abstract: Over the past decade there has been considerable interest in spectral algorithms
  for learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs). Spectral algorithms have appealing
  theoretical guarantees; however, the resulting models do not always perform well
  on inference tasks in practice. One reason for this behavior is the mismatch between
  the intended task (accurate filtering or prediction) and the loss function being
  optimized by the algorithm (estimation error in model parameters).   A natural idea
  is to improve performance by refining PSRs using an algorithm such as EM. Unfortunately
  it is not obvious how to apply apply an EM style algorithm in the context of PSRs
  as the Log Likelihood is not well defined for all PSRs. We show that it is possible
  to overcome this problem using ideas from Predictive State Inference Machines.   We
  combine spectral algorithms for PSRs as a consistent and efficient initialization
  with PSIM-style updates to refine the resulting model parameters. By combining these
  two ideas we develop Inference Gradients, a simple, fast, and robust method for
  practical learning of PSRs. Inference Gradients performs gradient descent in the
  PSR parameter space to optimize an inference-based loss function like PSIM. Because
  Inference Gradients uses a spectral initialization we get the same consistency benefits
  as PSRs. We show that Inference Gradients outperforms both PSRs and PSIMs on real
  and synthetic data sets.
