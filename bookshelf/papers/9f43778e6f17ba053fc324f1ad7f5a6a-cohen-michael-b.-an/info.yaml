abstract: 'This paper shows how to solve linear programs of the form $\min_{Ax=b,x\geq0}
  c^\top x$ with $n$ variables in time $$O^*((n^{\omega}+n^{2.5-\alpha/2}+n^{2+1/6})
  \log(n/\delta))$$ where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, $\alpha$
  is the dual exponent of matrix multiplication, and $\delta$ is the relative accuracy.
  For the current value of $\omega\sim2.37$ and $\alpha\sim0.31$, our algorithm takes
  $O^*(n^{\omega} \log(n/\delta))$ time. When $\omega = 2$, our algorithm takes $O^*(n^{2+1/6}
  \log(n/\delta))$ time.   Our algorithm utilizes several new concepts that we believe
  may be of independent interest:   $\bullet$ We define a stochastic central path
  method.   $\bullet$ We show how to maintain a projection matrix $\sqrt{W}A^{\top}(AWA^{\top})^{-1}A\sqrt{W}$
  in sub-quadratic time under $\ell_{2}$ multiplicative changes in the diagonal matrix
  $W$.'
