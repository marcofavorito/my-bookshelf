abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in the past few
  years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems have been solved in tasks
  such as game playing and robotics. Unfortunately, the sample complexity of most
  deep reinforcement learning methods is high, precluding their use in some important
  applications. Model-based reinforcement learning creates an explicit model of the
  environment dynamics to reduce the need for environment samples. Current deep learning
  methods use high-capacity networks to solve high-dimensional problems. Unfortunately,
  high-capacity models typically require many samples, negating the potential benefit
  of lower sample complexity in model-based methods. A challenge for deep model-based
  methods is therefore to achieve high predictive power while maintaining low sample
  complexity. In recent years, many model-based methods have been introduced to address
  this challenge. In this paper, we survey the contemporary model-based landscape.
  First we discuss definitions and relations to other fields. We propose a taxonomy
  based on three approaches: using explicit planning on given transitions, using explicit
  planning on learned transitions, and end-to-end learning of both planning and transitions.
  We use these approaches to organize a comprehensive overview of important recent
  developments such as latent models. We describe methods and benchmarks, and we suggest
  directions for future work for each of the approaches. Among promising research
  directions are curriculum learning, uncertainty modeling, and use of latent models
  for transfer learning.'
