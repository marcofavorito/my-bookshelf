abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as agents to complete
  different tasks, such as personal assistance or event planning. While most work
  has focused on cooperation and collaboration between agents, little work explores
  competition, another important mechanism that fosters the development of society
  and economy. In this paper, we seek to examine the competition behaviors in LLM-based
  agents. We first propose a general framework to study the competition between agents.
  Then, we implement a practical competitive environment using GPT-4 to simulate a
  virtual town with two types of agents, including restaurant agents and customer
  agents. Specifically, restaurant agents compete with each other to attract more
  customers, where the competition fosters them to transform, such as cultivating
  new operating strategies. The results of our experiments reveal several interesting
  findings ranging from social learning to Matthew Effect, which aligns well with
  existing sociological and economic theories. We believe that competition between
  agents deserves further investigation to help us understand society better. The
  code will be released soon.
