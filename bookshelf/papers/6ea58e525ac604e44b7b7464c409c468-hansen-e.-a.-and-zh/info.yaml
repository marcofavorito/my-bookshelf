abstract: We describe how to convert the heuristic search algorithm A* into an anytime
  algorithm that finds a sequence of improved solutions and eventually converges to
  an optimal solution. The approach we adopt uses weighted heuristic search to find
  an approximate solution quickly, and then continues the weighted search to find
  improved solutions as well as to improve a bound on the suboptimality of the current
  solution. When the time available to solve a search problem is limited or uncertain,
  this creates an anytime heuristic search algorithm that allows a flexible tradeoff
  between search time and solution quality. We analyze the properties of the resulting
  Anytime A* algorithm, and consider its performance in three domains; sliding-tile
  puzzles, STRIPS planning, and multiple sequence alignment. To illustrate the generality
  of this approach, we also describe how to transform the memory-efficient search
  algorithm Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) into an anytime algorithm.
