abstract: A definition of Artificial Intelligence was proposed in [1] but this definition
  was not absolutely formal at least because the word "Human" was used. In this paper
  we will formalize the definition from [1]. The biggest problem in this definition
  was that the level of intelligence of AI is compared to the intelligence of a human
  being. In order to change this we will introduce some parameters to which AI will
  depend. One of this parameters will be the level of intelligence and we will define
  one AI to each level of intelligence. We assume that for some level of intelligence
  the respective AI will be more intelligent than a human being. Nevertheless, we
  cannot say which is this level because we cannot calculate its exact value.
