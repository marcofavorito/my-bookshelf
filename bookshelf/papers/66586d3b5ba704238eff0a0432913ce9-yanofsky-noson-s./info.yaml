abstract: We define an algorithm to be the set of programs that implement or express
  that algorithm. The set of all programs is partitioned into equivalence classes.
  Two programs are equivalent if they are essentially the same program. The set of
  equivalence classes forms the category of algorithms. Although the set of programs
  does not even form a category, the set of algorithms form a category with extra
  structure. The conditions we give that describe when two programs are essentially
  the same turn out to be coherence relations that enrich the category of algorithms
  with extra structure. Universal properties of the category of algorithms are proved.
