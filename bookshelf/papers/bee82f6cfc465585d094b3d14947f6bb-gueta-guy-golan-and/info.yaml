abstract: 'SBFT is a state of the art Byzantine fault tolerant permissioned blockchain
  system that addresses the challenges of scalability, decentralization and world-scale
  geo-replication. SBFTis optimized for decentralization and can easily handle more
  than 200 active replicas in a real world-scale deployment. We evaluate \sysname
  in a world-scale geo-replicated deployment with 209 replicas withstanding f=64 Byzantine
  failures. We provide experiments that show how the different algorithmic ingredients
  of \sysname increase its performance and scalability. The results show that SBFT
  simultaneously provides almost 2x better throughput and about 1.5x better latency
  relative to a highly optimized system that implements the PBFT protocol. To achieve
  this performance improvement, SBFT uses a combination of four ingredients: using
  collectors and threshold signatures to reduce communication to linear, using an
  optimistic fast path, reducing client communication and utilizing redundant servers
  for the fast path.'
