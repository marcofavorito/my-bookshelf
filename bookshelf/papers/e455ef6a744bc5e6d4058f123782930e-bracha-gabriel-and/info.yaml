abstract: "<jats:p>\n            A consensus protocol enables a system of\n      \
  \      <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            asynchronous processes, some of\
  \ which are faulty, to reach agreement. There are two kinds of faulty processes:\
  \ fail-stop processes that can only die and malicious processes that can also send\
  \ false messages. The class of asynchronous systems with fair schedulers is defined,\
  \ and consensus protocols that terminate with probability 1 for these systems are\
  \ investigated. With fail-stop processes, it is shown that ⌈(\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n\
  \            + 1)/2⌉ correct processes are necessary and sufficient to reach agreement.\
  \ In the malicious case, it is shown that ⌈(2\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n\
  \            + 1)/3⌉ correct processes are necessary and sufficient to reach agreement.\
  \ This is contrasted with an earlier result, stating that there is no consensus\
  \ protocol for the fail-stop case that always terminates within a bounded number\
  \ of steps, even if only one process can fail. The possibility of reliable broadcast\
  \ (Byzantine Agreement) in asynchronous systems is also investigated. Asynchronous\
  \ Byzantine Agreement is defined, and it is shown that ⌈(2\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n\
  \            + 1)/3⌉ correct processes are necessary and sufficient to achieve it.\n\
