abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method for controller synthesis
  of autonomous systems in unknown and partially-observable environments with subjective
  time-dependent safety constraints. Mathematically, we model the system dynamics
  by a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with unknown transition/observation
  probabilities. The time-dependent safety constraint is captured by iLTL, a variation
  of linear temporal logic for state distributions. Our Reinforcement learning method
  first constructs the belief MDP of the POMDP, capturing the time evolution of estimated
  state distributions. Then, by building the product belief MDP of the belief MDP
  and the limiting deterministic B\uchi automaton (LDBA) of the temporal logic constraint,
  we transform the time-dependent safety constraint on the POMDP into a state-dependent
  constraint on the product belief MDP. Finally, we learn the optimal policy by value
  iteration under the state-dependent constraint.
