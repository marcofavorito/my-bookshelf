abstract: This paper focuses on LTL on finite traces (LTLf) for which satisfiability
  is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, little is known about the computational
  properties of fragments of LTLf. In this paper we fill this gap and make the following
  contributions. First, we identify several LTLf fragments for which the complexity
  of satisfiability drops to NP-complete or even P, by considering restrictions on
  the temporal operators and Boolean connectives being allowed. Second, we study a
  semantic variant of LTLf, which is of interest in the domain of business processes,
  where models have the property that precisely one propositional variable evaluates
  true at each time instant. Third, we introduce a reasoner for LTLf and compare its
  performance with the state of the art.
