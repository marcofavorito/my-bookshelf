abstract: <jats:p>This article gives an introduction to agent-based modeling and simulation
  (ABMS). After a general discussion about modeling and simulation, we address the
  basic concept of ABMS, focusing on its generative and bottom-up nature, its advantages
  as well as its pitfalls. The subsequent part of the article deals with application-oriented
  aspects, including selected tools and well-known applications. In order to illustrate
  the benefits of using ABMS, we focus on several aspects of a well-known area related
  to simulation of complex systems, namely traffic. At the end, a brief look into
  future challenges is given.</jats:p>
