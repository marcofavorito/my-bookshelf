abstract: We survey a current, heated debate in the AI research community on whether
  large pre-trained language models can be said to "understand" language -- and the
  physical and social situations language encodes -- in any important sense. We describe
  arguments that have been made for and against such understanding, and key questions
  for the broader sciences of intelligence that have arisen in light of these arguments.
  We contend that a new science of intelligence can be developed that will provide
  insight into distinct modes of understanding, their strengths and limitations, and
  the challenge of integrating diverse forms of cognition.
