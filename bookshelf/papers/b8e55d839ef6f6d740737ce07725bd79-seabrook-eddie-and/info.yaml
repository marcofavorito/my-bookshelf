abstract: Markov chains are a class of probabilistic models that have achieved widespread
  application in the quantitative sciences. This is in part due to their versatility,
  but is compounded by the ease with which they can be probed analytically. This tutorial
  provides an in-depth introduction to Markov chains, and explores their connection
  to graphs and random walks. We utilize tools from linear algebra and graph theory
  to describe the transition matrices of different types of Markov chains, with a
  particular focus on exploring properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding
  to these matrices. The results presented are relevant to a number of methods in
  machine learning and data mining, which we describe at various stages. Rather than
  being a novel academic study in its own right, this text presents a collection of
  known results, together with some new concepts. Moreover, the tutorial focuses on
  offering intuition to readers rather than formal understanding, and only assumes
  basic exposure to concepts from linear algebra and probability theory. It is therefore
  accessible to students and researchers from a wide variety of disciplines.
