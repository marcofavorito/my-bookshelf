abstract: We first propose algorithms for checking language equivalence of finite
  automata over a large alphabet. We use symbolic automata, where the transition function
  is compactly represented using a (multi-terminal) binary decision diagrams (BDD).
  The key idea consists in computing a bisimulation by exploring reachable pairs symbolically,
  so as to avoid redundancies. This idea can be combined with already existing optimisations,
  and we show in particular a nice integration with the disjoint sets forest data-structure
  from Hopcroft and Karp's standard algorithm. Then we consider Kleene algebra with
  tests (KAT), an algebraic theory that can be used for verification in various domains
  ranging from compiler optimisation to network programming analysis. This theory
  is decidable by reduction to language equivalence of automata on guarded strings,
  a particular kind of automata that have exponentially large alphabets. We propose
  several methods allowing to construct symbolic automata out of KAT expressions,
  based either on Brzozowski's derivatives or standard automata constructions. All
  in all, this results in efficient algorithms for deciding equivalence of KAT expressions.
