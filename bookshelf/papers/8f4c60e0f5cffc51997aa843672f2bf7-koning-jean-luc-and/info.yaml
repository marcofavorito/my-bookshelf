abstract: Successful development of agent interaction protocols requires modeling
  methods and tools that support a relatively complete development lifecycle. Agent-based
  systems are inherently complex but exhibit many similarities to object-oriented
  systems. For these reasons not only current modeling languages need to be extended,
  but also related tools should be provided for agent interaction protocol design
  to be supported. In this paper, we focus on the design stage of an agent interaction
  protocol development cycle. We start by giving general criteria for comparing agent
  modeling languages. The ones we take into consideration in this paper are extensions
  of Agent-UML and FIPA-UAML languages. We describe these languages and discuss some
  extensions on a simplified application of the Netbill electronic commerce protocol.
  We then briefly introduce a component-based formal specification language in order
  to support the protocol's design stage and present a tool built upon the FIPA norm
  (making use of the PDN or UAML notation) which supports the analysis and design
  of interaction protocols.
