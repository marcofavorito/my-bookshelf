abstract: 'This paper is a survey dedicated to the analogy between the notions of
  {\it complexity} in theoretical computer science and {\it energy} in physics. This
  analogy is not metaphorical: I describe three precise mathematical contexts, suggested
  recently, in which mathematics related to (un)computability is inspired by and to
  a degree reproduces formalisms of statistical physics and quantum field theory.'
