abstract: We study a reinforcement learning setting, where the state transition function
  is a convex combination of a stochastic continuous function and a deterministic
  function. Such a setting generalizes the widely-studied stochastic state transition
  setting, namely the setting of deterministic policy gradient (DPG).   We firstly
  give a simple example to illustrate that the deterministic policy gradient may be
  infinite under deterministic state transitions, and introduce a theoretical technique
  to prove the existence of the policy gradient in this generalized setting. Using
  this technique, we prove that the deterministic policy gradient indeed exists for
  a certain set of discount factors, and further prove two conditions that guarantee
  the existence for all discount factors. We then derive a closed form of the policy
  gradient whenever exists. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of high sample
  complexity of DPG in this setting, we propose the Generalized Deterministic Policy
  Gradient (GDPG) algorithm. The main innovation of the algorithm is a new method
  of applying model-based techniques to the model-free algorithm, the deep deterministic
  policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). GDPG optimize the long-term rewards of the model-based
  augmented MDP subject to a constraint that the long-rewards of the MDP is less than
  the original one.   We finally conduct extensive experiments comparing GDPG with
  state-of-the-art methods and the direct model-based extension method of DDPG on
  several standard continuous control benchmarks. Results demonstrate that GDPG substantially
  outperforms DDPG, the model-based extension of DDPG and other baselines in terms
  of both convergence and long-term rewards in most environments.
