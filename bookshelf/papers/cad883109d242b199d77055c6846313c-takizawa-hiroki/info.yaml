abstract: 'The game of Othello is one of the world''s most complex and popular games
  that has yet to be computationally solved. Othello has roughly ten octodecillion
  (10 to the 58th power) possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th power)
  possible game positions. The challenge of solving Othello, determining the outcome
  of a game with no mistake made by either player, has long been a grand challenge
  in computer science. This paper announces a significant milestone: Othello is now
  solved. It is computationally proved that perfect play by both players lead to a
  draw. Strong Othello software has long been built using heuristically designed search
  techniques. Solving a game provides a solution that enables the software to play
  the game perfectly.'
