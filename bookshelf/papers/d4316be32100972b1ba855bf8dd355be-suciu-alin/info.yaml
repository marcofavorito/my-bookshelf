abstract: The unification algorithm is at the core of the logic programming paradigm,
  the first unification algorithm being developed by Robinson [5]. More efficient
  algorithms were developed later [3] and I introduce here yet another efficient unification
  algorithm centered on a specific data structure, called the Unification Table.
