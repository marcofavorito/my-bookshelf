abstract: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols have recently been extensively
  used by decentralized data management systems with non-trustworthy infrastructures,
  e.g., permissioned blockchains. BFT protocols cover a broad spectrum of design dimensions
  from infrastructure settings such as the communication topology, to more technical
  features such as commitment strategy and even fundamental social choice properties
  like order-fairness. The proliferation of different BFT protocols has rendered it
  difficult to navigate the BFT landscape, let alone determine the protocol that best
  meets application needs. This paper presents Bedrock, a unified platform for BFT
  protocols design, analysis, implementation, and experiments. Bedrock proposes a
  design space consisting of a set of design choices capturing the trade-offs between
  different design space dimensions and providing fundamentally new insights into
  the strengths and weaknesses of BFT protocols. Bedrock enables users to analyze
  and experiment with BFT protocols within the space of plausible choices, evolve
  current protocols to design new ones, and even uncover previously unknown protocols.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the capability of Bedrock to uniformly evaluate
  BFT protocols in new ways that were not possible before due to the diverse assumptions
  made by these protocols. The results validate Bedrock's ability to analyze and derive
  BFT protocols.
