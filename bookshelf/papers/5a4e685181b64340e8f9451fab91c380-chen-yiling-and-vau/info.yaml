abstract: We explore the striking mathematical connections that exist between market
  scoring rules, cost function based prediction markets, and no-regret learning. We
  show that any cost function based prediction market can be interpreted as an algorithm
  for the commonly studied problem of learning from expert advice by equating trades
  made in the market with losses observed by the learning algorithm. If the loss of
  the market organizer is bounded, this bound can be used to derive an O(sqrt(T))
  regret bound for the corresponding learning algorithm. We then show that the class
  of markets with convex cost functions exactly corresponds to the class of Follow
  the Regularized Leader learning algorithms, with the choice of a cost function in
  the market corresponding to the choice of a regularizer in the learning problem.
  Finally, we show an equivalence between market scoring rules and prediction markets
  with convex cost functions. This implies that market scoring rules can also be interpreted
  naturally as Follow the Regularized Leader algorithms, and may be of independent
  interest. These connections provide new insight into how it is that commonly studied
  markets, such as the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule, can aggregate opinions into
  accurate estimates of the likelihood of future events.
