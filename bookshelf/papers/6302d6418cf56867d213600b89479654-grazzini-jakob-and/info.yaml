abstract: 'We consider Bayesian inference techniques for agent-based (AB) models,
  as an alternative to simulated minimum distance (SMD). Three computationally heavy
  steps are involved: (i) simulating the model, (ii) estimating the likelihood and
  (iii) sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Computational
  complexity of AB models implies that efficient techniques have to be used with respect
  to points (ii) and (iii), possibly involving approximations. We first discuss non-parametric
  (kernel density) estimation of the likelihood, coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo
  sampling schemes. We then turn to parametric approximations of the likelihood, which
  can be derived by observing the distribution of the simulation outcomes around the
  statistical equilibria, or by assuming a specific form for the distribution of external
  deviations in the data. Finally, we introduce Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques
  for likelihood-free estimation. These allow embedding SMD methods in a Bayesian
  framework, and are particularly suited when robust estimation is needed. These techniques
  are first tested in a simple price discovery model with one parameter, and then
  employed to estimate the behavioural macroeconomic model of De Grauwe (2012), with
  nine unknown parameters.'
