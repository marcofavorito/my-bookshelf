abstract: Exponential families and mixture families are parametric probability models
  that can be geometrically studied as smooth statistical manifolds with respect to
  any statistical divergence like the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the Hellinger
  divergence. When equipping a statistical manifold with the KL divergence, the induced
  manifold structure is dually flat, and the KL divergence between distributions amounts
  to an equivalent Bregman divergence on their corresponding parameters. In practice,
  the corresponding Bregman generators of mixture/exponential families require to
  perform definite integral calculus that can either be too time-consuming (for exponentially
  large discrete support case) or even do not admit closed-form formula (for continuous
  support case). In these cases, the dually flat construction remains theoretical
  and cannot be used by information-geometric algorithms. To bypass this problem,
  we consider performing stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) estimation of those integral-based
  mixture/exponential family Bregman generators. We show that, under natural assumptions,
  these MC generators are almost surely Bregman generators. We define a series of
  dually flat information geometries, termed Monte Carlo Information Geometries, that
  increasingly-finely approximate the untractable geometry. The advantage of this
  MCIG is that it allows a practical use of the Bregman algorithmic toolbox on a wide
  range of probability distribution families. We demonstrate our approach with a clustering
  task on a mixture family manifold.
