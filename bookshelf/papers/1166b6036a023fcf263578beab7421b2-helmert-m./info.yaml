abstract: '<jats:p>Fast Downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic
  search. It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the
  propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions
  and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such
  as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world
  states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning
  systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning
  task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation
  called multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints
  of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative representation,
  Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its
  heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from
  traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators.


  In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downward''s approach to solving
  multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph
  heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel
  techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downward''s best-first search
  algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search
  to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates
  the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic
  best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single
  search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures
  for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present
  a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search,
  which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way.


  Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the "classical'''' (i.e.,
  propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition
  at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments
  show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions
  and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.
