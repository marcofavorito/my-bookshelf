abstract: In the philosophical literature, the term “abduction” isused in two related
  but different senses. In both senses, the termrefers to some form of explanatory
  reasoning. However, in thehistorically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatoryreasoning
  in generating hypotheses, while in the sense inwhich it is used most frequently
  in the modern literature it refers tothe place of explanatory reasoning in justifying
  hypotheses.In the latter sense, abduction is also often called “Inferenceto the
  Best Explanation.”, This entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modernsense,
  although there is a supplement on abduction in the historicalsense, which had its
  origin in the work of Charles SandersPeirce—see the, See also the entry on scientific
  discovery, in particular the section on discovery as abduction., Most philosophers
  agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference tothe Best Explanation) is a type
  of inference that is frequentlyemployed, in some form or other, both in everyday
  and in scientificreasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status
  ofabduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrastsabduction with
  other types of inference; points at prominent uses ofit, both in and outside philosophy;
  considers various more or lessprecise statements of it; discusses its normative
  status; andhighlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesianconfirmation
  theory.
