abstract: The use of spatio-temporal logics in control is motivated by the need to
  impose complex spatial and temporal behavior on dynamical systems, and to control
  these systems accordingly. Synthesizing correct-by-design control laws is a challenging
  task resulting in computationally demanding methods. We consider efficient automata-based
  planning for continuous-time systems under signal interval temporal logic specifications,
  an expressive fragment of signal temporal logic. The planning is based on recent
  results for automata-based verification of metric interval temporal logic. A timed
  signal transducer is obtained accepting all Boolean signals that satisfy a metric
  interval temporal logic specification, which is abstracted from the signal interval
  temporal logic specification at hand. This transducer is modified to account for
  the spatial properties of the signal interval temporal logic specification, characterizing
  all real-valued signals that satisfy this specification. Using logic-based feedback
  control laws, such as the ones we have presented in earlier works, we then provide
  an abstraction of the system that, in a suitable way, aligns with the modified timed
  signal transducer. This allows to avoid the state space explosion that is typically
  induced by forming a product automaton between an abstraction of the system and
  the specification.
