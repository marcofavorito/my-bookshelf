abstract: 'There are over 15 distinct communities that work in the general area of
  sequential decisions and information, often referred to as decisions under uncertainty
  or stochastic optimization. We focus on two of the most important fields: stochastic
  optimal control, with its roots in deterministic optimal control, and reinforcement
  learning, with its roots in Markov decision processes. Building on prior work, we
  describe a unified framework that covers all 15 different communities, and note
  the strong parallels with the modeling framework of stochastic optimal control.
  By contrast, we make the case that the modeling framework of reinforcement learning,
  inherited from discrete Markov decision processes, is quite limited. Our framework
  (and that of stochastic control) is based on the core problem of optimizing over
  policies. We describe four classes of policies that we claim are universal, and
  show that each of these two fields have, in their own way, evolved to include examples
  of each of these four classes.'
