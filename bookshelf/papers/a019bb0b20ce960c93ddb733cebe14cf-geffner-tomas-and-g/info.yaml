abstract: Fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning is becoming increasingly
  important as an approach for computing proper policies in probabilistic planning,
  extended temporal plans in LTL planning, and general plans in generalized planning.
  In this work, we introduce a SAT encoding for FOND planning that is compact and
  can produce compact strong cyclic policies. Simple variations of the encodings are
  also introduced for strong planning and for what we call, dual FOND planning, where
  some non-deterministic actions are assumed to be fair (e.g., probabilistic) and
  others unfair (e.g., adversarial). The resulting FOND planners are compared empirically
  with existing planners over existing and new benchmarks. The notion of "probabilistic
  interesting problems" is also revisited to yield a more comprehensive picture of
  the strengths and limitations of current FOND planners and the proposed SAT approach.
