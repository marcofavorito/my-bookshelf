abstract: 'Investigations of quantum and mesoscopic thermodynamics force one to answer
  two fundamental questions associated with the foundations of statistical mechanics:
  (i) how does macroscopic irreversibility emerge from microscopic reversibility?
  (ii) how does the system relax in general to thermal equilibrium with its environment?
  The answers to these questions rely on a deep understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics
  of systems interacting with their environments. Decoherence is also a main concern
  in developing quantum information technology. In the past two decades, many theoretical
  and experimental investigations have devoted to this topic, most of these investigations
  take the Markov (memory-less) approximation. These investigations have provided
  a partial understanding to several fundamental issues, such as quantum measurement
  and the quantum-to-classical transition, etc. However, experimental implementations
  of nanoscale solid-state quantum information processing makes strong non-Markovian
  memory effects unavoidable, thus rendering their study a pressing and vital issue.
  Through the rigorous derivation of the exact master equation and a systematical
  exploration of various non-Markovian processes for a large class of open quantum
  systems, we find that decoherence manifests unexpected complexities. We demonstrate
  these general non-Markovian dynamics manifested in different open quantum systems.'
