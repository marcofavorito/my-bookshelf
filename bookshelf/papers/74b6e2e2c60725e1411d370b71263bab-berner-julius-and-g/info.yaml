abstract: 'We describe the new field of mathematical analysis of deep learning. This
  field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within
  the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding
  generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep
  architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly
  successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding
  what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in
  physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior
  of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that
  yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the
  main ideas in more detail.'
