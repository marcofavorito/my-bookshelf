abstract: We study reasoning with existential rules to perform query answering over
  streams of data. On static databases, this problem has been widely studied, but
  its extension to rapidly changing data has not yet been considered. To bridge this
  gap, we extend LARS, a well-known framework for rule-based stream reasoning, to
  support existential rules. For that, we show how to translate LARS with existentials
  into a semantics-preserving set of existential rules. As query answering with such
  rules is undecidable in general, we describe how to leverage the temporal nature
  of streams and present suitable notions of acyclicity that ensure decidability.
