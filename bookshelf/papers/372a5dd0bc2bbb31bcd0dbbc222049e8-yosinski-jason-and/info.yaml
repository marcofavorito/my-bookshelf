abstract: Recent years have produced great advances in training large, deep neural
  networks (DNNs), including notable successes in training convolutional neural networks
  (convnets) to recognize natural images. However, our understanding of how these
  models work, especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers, has
  lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development
  of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such
  tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each
  layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam
  stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response
  to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second
  tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization
  in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable
  images, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce
  qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source
  and work on a pre-trained convnet with minimal setup.
