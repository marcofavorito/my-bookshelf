abstract: This paper adds to the efforts of evolutionary ethics to naturalize morality
  by providing specific insights derived from a computational ethics view. We propose
  a stylized model of human decision-making, which is based on Reinforcement Learning,
  one of the most successful paradigms in Artificial Intelligence. After the main
  concepts related to Reinforcement Learning have been presented, some particularly
  useful parallels are drawn that can illuminate evolutionary accounts of ethics.
  Specifically, we investigate the existence of an optimal policy (or, as we will
  refer to, objective ethical principles) given the conditions of an agent. In addition,
  we will show how this policy is learnable by means of trial and error, supporting
  our hypotheses on two well-known theorems in the context of Reinforcement Learning.
  We conclude by discussing how the proposed framework can be enlarged to study other
  potentially interesting areas of human behavior from a formalizable perspective.
