abstract: <jats:p>We study the complexity and expressive power of conjunctive queries
  over unranked labeled trees represented using a variety of structure relations such
  as “child”, “descendant”, and “following” as well as unary relations for node labels.
  We establish a framework for characterizing structures representing trees for which
  conjunctive queries can be evaluated efficiently. Then we completely chart the tractability
  frontier of the problem and establish a dichotomy theorem for our axis relations,
  that is, we find all subset-maximal sets of axes for which query evaluation is in
  polynomial time and show that for all other cases, query evaluation is NP-complete.
  All polynomial-time results are obtained immediately using the proof techniques
  from our framework. Finally, we study the expressiveness of conjunctive queries
  over trees and show that for each conjunctive query, there is an equivalent acyclic
  positive query (i.e., a set of acyclic conjunctive queries), but that in general
  this query is not of polynomial size.</jats:p>
