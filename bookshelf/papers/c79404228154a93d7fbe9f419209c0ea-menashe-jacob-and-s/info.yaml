abstract: Recent successes in Reinforcement Learning have encouraged a fast-growing
  network of RL researchers and a number of breakthroughs in RL research. As the RL
  community and the body of RL work grows, so does the need for widely applicable
  benchmarks that can fairly and effectively evaluate a variety of RL algorithms.   This
  need is particularly apparent in the realm of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
  (HRL). While many existing test domains may exhibit hierarchical action or state
  structures, modern RL algorithms still exhibit great difficulty in solving domains
  that necessitate hierarchical modeling and action planning, even when such domains
  are seemingly trivial. These difficulties highlight both the need for more focus
  on HRL algorithms themselves, and the need for new testbeds that will encourage
  and validate HRL research.   Existing HRL testbeds exhibit a Goldilocks problem;
  they are often either too simple (e.g. Taxi) or too complex (e.g. Montezuma's Revenge
  from the Arcade Learning Environment). In this paper we present the Escape Room
  Domain (ERD), a new flexible, scalable, and fully implemented testing domain for
  HRL that bridges the "moderate complexity" gap left behind by existing alternatives.
  ERD is open-source and freely available through GitHub, and conforms to widely-used
  public testing interfaces for simple integration and testing with a variety of public
  RL agent implementations. We show that the ERD presents a suite of challenges with
  scalable difficulty to provide a smooth learning gradient from Taxi to the Arcade
  Learning Environment.
