abstract: 'The question if a deterministic finite automaton admits a software reset
  in the form of a so-called synchronizing word can be answered in polynomial time.
  In this paper, we extend this algorithmic question to deterministic automata beyond
  finite automata. We prove that the question of synchronizability becomes undecidable
  even when looking at deterministic one-counter automata. This is also true for another
  classical mild extension of regularity, namely that of deterministic one-turn push-down
  automata. However, when we combine both restrictions, we arrive at scenarios with
  a PSPACE-complete (and hence decidable) synchronizability problem. Likewise, we
  arrive at a decidable synchronizability problem for (partially) blind deterministic
  counter automata.   There are several interpretations of what synchronizability
  should mean for deterministic push-down automata. This is depending on the role
  of the stack: should it be empty on synchronization, should it be always the same
  or is it arbitrary? For the automata classes studied in this paper, the complexity
  or decidability status of the synchronizability problem is mostly independent of
  this technicality, but we also discuss one class of automata where this makes a
  difference.'
