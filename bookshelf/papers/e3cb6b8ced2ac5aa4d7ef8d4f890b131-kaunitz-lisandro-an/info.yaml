abstract: The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build
  forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several
  betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction
  models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been
  inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the
  online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers
  with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with
  bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the
  odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our
  strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds,
  a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period
  during which we staked real money with the bookmakers (we made code, data and models
  publicly available). Our results demonstrate that the football betting market is
  inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of games in
  both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a detailed description
  of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports gambling industry compensates
  these market inefficiencies with discriminatory practices against successful clients.
