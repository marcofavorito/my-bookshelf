abstract: The purpose of this paper is to give an easy to understand with step-by-step
  explanation to allow interested people to fully appreciate the power of natural
  deduction for first-order logic. Natural deduction as a proof system can be used
  to prove various statements in propositional logic, but we will see its extension
  to cover quantifiers which gives it more power over propositional logic in solving
  more complex, real-world problems. We started by going over logical connectives
  and quantifiers to agree on the symbols that will be used throughout the paper,
  as some authors use different symbols to refer to the same thing. Besides, we showed
  the inference rules that are used the most. Furthermore, we presented the soundness
  and completeness of natural deduction for first-order logic. Finally, we solved
  examples ranging from easy to complex to give you different circumstances in which
  you can apply the proof system to solve problems you may encounter. Hopefully, this
  paper will be helpful makes the subject easy to understand.
