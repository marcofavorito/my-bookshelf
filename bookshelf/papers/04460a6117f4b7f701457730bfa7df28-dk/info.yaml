abstract: Are men's and women's brains really different? Why are teenagers impulsive
  and rebellious? And will it soon be possible to link our brains together via the
  Cloud?Drawing on the latest neuroscience research, this visual guide makes the hidden
  workings of the human brain simple to understand. How the Brain Works begins with
  an introduction to the brain's anatomy, showing you how to tell your motor cortex
  from your mirror neurons. Moving on to function, it explains how the brain works
  constantly and unnoticed to regulate heartbeat and breathing, and how it collects
  information to produce the experiences of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
  The chapters that follow cover memory and learning, consciousness and personality,
  and emotions and communication.There's also a guide to the brain's disorders, including
  physical problems, such as tumors and strokes, and psychological and functional
  disorders, ranging from autism to schizophrenia. Illustrated with bold graphics
  and step-by-step artworks, and sprinkled with bite-sized factoids and question-and-answer
  features, this is the perfect introduction to the fascinating world of the human
  brain.
