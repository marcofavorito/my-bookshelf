abstract: Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) integration combines symbolic reasoning with Neural
  Networks (NNs) for tasks requiring perception and reasoning. Most NeSy systems rely
  on continuous relaxation of logical knowledge, and no discrete decisions are made
  within the model pipeline. Furthermore, these methods assume that the symbolic rules
  are given. In this paper, we propose Deep Symbolic Learning (DSL), a NeSy system
  that learns NeSy-functions, i.e., the composition of a (set of) perception functions
  which map continuous data to discrete symbols, and a symbolic function over the
  set of symbols. DSL learns simultaneously the perception and symbolic functions
  while being trained only on their composition (NeSy-function). The key novelty of
  DSL is that it can create internal (interpretable) symbolic representations and
  map them to perception inputs within a differentiable NN learning pipeline. The
  created symbols are automatically selected to generate symbolic functions that best
  explain the data. We provide experimental analysis to substantiate the efficacy
  of DSL in simultaneously learning perception and symbolic functions.
