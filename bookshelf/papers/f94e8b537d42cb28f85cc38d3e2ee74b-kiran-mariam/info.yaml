abstract: Social scientists have used agent-based models to understand how individuals
  interact and behave in various political, ecological and economic scenarios. Agent-based
  models are ideal for understanding such models involving interacting individuals
  producing emergent phenomenon. Sugarscape is one of the most famous examples of
  a social agent-based model which has been used to show how societies grow in the
  real world.   This paper builds on the Sugarscape model, using the Flexible Large
  scale Agent-based modelling Environment (FLAME) to simulate three different scenarios
  of the experiment, which are based on the Sugar and Citizen locations. FLAME is
  an agent-based modelling framework which has previously been used to model biological
  and economic models. The paper includes details on how the model was written and
  the various parameters set for the simulation. The results of the model simulated
  are processed for three scenarios and analysed to see what affect the initial starting
  states of the agents had on the overall result obtained through the model and the
  variance in simulation time of processing the model on multicore architectures.   The
  experiments highlight that there are limitations of the FLAME framework and writing
  simulation models in general which are highly dependent on initial starting states
  of a model, also raising further potential work which can be built into the Sugarscape
  model to study other interesting phenomenon in social and economic laws.
