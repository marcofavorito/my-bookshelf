abstract: Sharding distributed ledgers is the most promising on-chain solution for
  scaling blockchain technology. In this work, we define and analyze the properties
  a sharded distributed ledger should fulfill. More specifically, we show that a sharded
  blockchain cannot be scalable under a fully adaptive adversary, but it can scale
  up to $O(n/\log n)$ under an epoch-adaptive adversary. This is possible only if
  the distributed ledger creates succinct proofs of the valid state updates at the
  end of each epoch. Our model builds upon and extends the Bitcoin backbone protocol
  by defining consistency and scalability. Consistency encompasses the need for atomic
  execution of cross-shard transactions to preserve safety, whereas scalability encapsulates
  the speedup a sharded system can gain in comparison to a non-sharded system. We
  introduce a protocol abstraction and highlight the sufficient components for secure
  and efficient sharding in our model. In order to show the power of our framework,
  we analyze the most prominent shared blockchains (Elastico, Monoxide, OmniLedger,
  RapidChain) and pinpoint where they fail to meet the desired properties.
