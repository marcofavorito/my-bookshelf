abstract: Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary payment system with its decentralized
  ledger concept; however it has significant problems such as high transaction fees
  and low throughput. Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced much later, solves
  most of these problems with an innovative concept called off-chain payments. With
  this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive venue to perform micro-payments
  which can also be adopted in many IoT applications (e.g., toll payments). Nevertheless,
  it is not feasible to host LN and Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory,
  and processing restrictions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure and efficient
  protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through an untrusted gateway
  node. Through this gateway which hosts the LN and Bitcoin nodes, the IoT device
  can open & close LN channels and send & receive LN payments. This delegation approach
  is powered by a threshold cryptography based scheme that requires the IoT device
  and the LN gateway to jointly perform all LN operations. Specifically, we propose
  thresholdizing LN's Bitcoin public and private keys as well as its public and private
  keys for the new channel states (i.e., commitment points). We prove with a game
  theoretical security analysis that the IoT device is secure against collusion and
  stealing attacks. We implemented the proposed protocol by changing LN's source code
  and thoroughly evaluated its performance using a Raspberry Pi. Our evaluation results
  show that the protocol is fast, does not bring extra cost overhead and can be run
  on low data-rate wireless networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work that implemented threshold cryptography in LN.
