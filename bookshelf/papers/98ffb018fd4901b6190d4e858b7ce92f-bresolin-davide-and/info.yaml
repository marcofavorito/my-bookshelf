abstract: We investigate the satisfiability problem for Horn fragments of the Halpern-Shoham
  interval temporal logic depending on the type (box or diamond) of the interval modal
  operators, the type of the underlying linear order (discrete or dense), and the
  type of semantics for the interval relations (reflexive or irreflexive). For example,
  we show that satisfiability of Horn formulas with diamonds is undecidable for any
  type of linear orders and semantics. On the contrary, satisfiability of Horn formulas
  with boxes is tractable over both discrete and dense orders under the reflexive
  semantics and over dense orders under the irreflexive semantics, but becomes undecidable
  over discrete orders under the irreflexive semantics. Satisfiability of binary Horn
  formulas with both boxes and diamonds is always undecidable under the irreflexive
  semantics.
