abstract: We design temporal description logics suitable for reasoning about temporal
  conceptual data models and investigate their computational complexity. Our formalisms
  are based on DL-Lite logics with three types of concept inclusions (ranging from
  atomic concept inclusions and disjointness to the full Booleans), as well as cardinality
  constraints and role inclusions. In the temporal dimension, they capture future
  and past temporal operators on concepts, flexible and rigid roles, the operators
  `always' and `some time' on roles, data assertions for particular moments of time
  and global concept inclusions. The logics are interpreted over the Cartesian products
  of object domains and the flow of time (Z,<), satisfying the constant domain assumption.
  We prove that the most expressive of our temporal description logics (which can
  capture lifespan cardinalities and either qualitative or quantitative evolution
  constraints) turn out to be undecidable. However, by omitting some of the temporal
  operators on concepts/roles or by restricting the form of concept inclusions we
  obtain logics whose complexity ranges between PSpace and NLogSpace. These positive
  results were obtained by reduction to various clausal fragments of propositional
  temporal logic, which opens a way to employ propositional or first-order temporal
  provers for reasoning about temporal data models.
