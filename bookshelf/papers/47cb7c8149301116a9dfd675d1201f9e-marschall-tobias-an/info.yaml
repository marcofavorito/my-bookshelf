abstract: 'We present probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs), a general model to
  describe chains of operations whose operands depend on chance, along with two different
  algorithms to exactly calculate the distribution of the results obtained by such
  probabilistic calculations. PAAs provide a unifying framework to approach many problems
  arising in computational biology and elsewhere. Here, we present five different
  applications, namely (1) pattern matching statistics on random texts, including
  the computation of the distribution of occurrence counts, waiting time and clump
  size under HMM background models; (2) exact analysis of window-based pattern matching
  algorithms; (3) sensitivity of filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence
  alignments; (4) length and mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting from enzymatic
  cleavage reactions; and (5) read length statistics of 454 sequencing reads. The
  diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying character
  of the presented framework.   While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular
  application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method for pattern
  statistics: We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic
  calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given DAA
  and a finite-memory random text model. We show how to transform a finite automaton
  into a DAA and then into the corresponding PAA.'
