abstract: (Phys.org)â€”When biologist Anthony Cashmore claims that the concept of free
  will is an illusion, he's not breaking any new ground. At least as far back as the
  ancient Greeks, people have wondered how humans seem to have the ability to make
  their own personal decisions in a manner lacking any causal component other than
  their desire to will something. But Cashmore, Professor of Biology at the University
  of Pennsylvania, says that many biologists today still cling to the idea of free
  will, and reject the idea that we are simply conscious machines, completely controlled
  by a combination of our chemistry and external environmental forces.
