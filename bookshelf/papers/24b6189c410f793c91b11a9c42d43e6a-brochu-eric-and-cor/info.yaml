abstract: We present a tutorial on Bayesian optimization, a method of finding the
  maximum of expensive cost functions. Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian
  technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence
  to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next
  observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both
  exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling
  areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present
  two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user
  modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a discussion
  of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.
