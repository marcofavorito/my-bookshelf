abstract: Benchmarks play an important role in the development of machine learning
  algorithms. For example, research in reinforcement learning (RL) has been heavily
  influenced by available environments and benchmarks. However, RL environments are
  traditionally run on the CPU, limiting their scalability with typical academic compute.
  Recent advancements in JAX have enabled the wider use of hardware acceleration to
  overcome these computational hurdles, enabling massively parallel RL training pipelines
  and environments. This is particularly useful for multi-agent reinforcement learning
  (MARL) research. First of all, multiple agents must be considered at each environment
  step, adding computational burden, and secondly, the sample complexity is increased
  due to non-stationarity, decentralised partial observability, or other MARL challenges.
  In this paper, we present JaxMARL, the first open-source code base that combines
  ease-of-use with GPU enabled efficiency, and supports a large number of commonly
  used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. When considering
  wall clock time, our experiments show that per-run our JAX-based training pipeline
  is up to 12500x faster than existing approaches. This enables efficient and thorough
  evaluations, with the potential to alleviate the evaluation crisis of the field.
  We also introduce and benchmark SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the popular
  StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II
  game engine. This not only enables GPU acceleration, but also provides a more flexible
  MARL environment, unlocking the potential for self-play, meta-learning, and other
  future applications in MARL. We provide code at https://github.com/flairox/jaxmarl.
