abstract: NLP is deeply intertwined with the formal study of language, both conceptually
  and historically. Arguably, this connection goes all the way back to Chomsky's Syntactic
  Structures in 1957. It also still holds true today, with a strand of recent works
  building formal analysis of modern neural networks methods in terms of formal languages.
  In this document, I aim to explain background about formal languages as they relate
  to this recent work. I will by necessity ignore large parts of the rich history
  of this field, instead focusing on concepts connecting to modern deep learning-based
  NLP.
