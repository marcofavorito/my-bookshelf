abstract: A blockchain is an append-only linked-list of blocks, which is maintained
  at each participating node. Each block records a set of transactions and their associated
  metadata. Blockchain transactions act on the identical ledger data stored at each
  node. Blockchain was first perceived by Satoshi Nakamoto as a peer-to-peer digital-commodity
  (also known as crypto-currency) exchange system. Blockchains received traction due
  to their inherent property of immutability-once a block is accepted, it cannot be
  reverted.
