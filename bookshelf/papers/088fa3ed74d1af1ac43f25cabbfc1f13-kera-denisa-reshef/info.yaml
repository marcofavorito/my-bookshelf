abstract: '<jats:p>Agreements, consensuses, protocols, resource-sharing, and fairness
  are all examples of social and political metaphors that define and shape new computational
  algorithms. The thought experiments and allegories about resource-sharing or agreement
  between nodes played a vital role in the development of "concurrent programming"
  (enabling processor power-sharing and process synchronization) and still later in
  the development of distributed computing (facilitating data access and synchronization).
  These paved the way for current concepts of consensus mechanisms, smart contracts,
  and other descriptions of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, distributed ledger, and
  hashgraph technologies, paradoxically reversing the relations between metaphor and
  artifact. New computing concepts and algorithmic processes, such as consensus mechanisms,
  trustless networks, and automated smart contracts or DAOs (Distributed Autonomous
  Organizations), aim to disrupt social contracts and political decision-making and
  replace economic, social, and political institutions (e.g., law, money, voting).
  Rather than something that needs a metaphor, algorithms are becoming the metaphor
  of good governance. Current fantasies of algorithmic governance exemplify this reversal
  of the role played by metaphors: they reduce all concepts of governance to automation
  and curtail opportunities for defining new computing challenges inspired by the
  original allegories, thought experiments, and metaphors. Especially now, when we
  are still learning how best to govern the transgressions and excesses of emerging
  distributed ledger technologies, productive relations between software and allegory,
  algorithms and metaphors, code and law are possible so long as they remain transitive.
  Against this tyranny of algorithms and technologies as metaphors and aspirational
  models of governance, we propose sandboxes and environments that allow stakeholders
  to combine prototyping with deliberation, algorithms with metaphors, codes with
  regulations.</jats:p>'
