abstract: 'The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major
  surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods
  easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems, and despite
  giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit effort to control
  model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture
  that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows
  gradient methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly
  impose regularization, and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting.
  We survey recent theoretical progress that provides examples illustrating these
  principles in simpler settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results
  and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods.
  We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient methods
  lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review
  prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems
  with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into
  a simple component that is useful for prediction and a spiky component that is useful
  for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does not harm prediction accuracy.
  We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where the network
  can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success
  of gradient flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving
  an exact asymptotic analysis that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization.
  We conclude by highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights
  to realistic deep learning settings.'
