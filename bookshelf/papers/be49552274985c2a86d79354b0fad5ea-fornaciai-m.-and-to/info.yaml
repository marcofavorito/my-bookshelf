abstract: <jats:p>What we see in the present is affected by what we saw in the recent
  past.<jats:italic>Serial dependence</jats:italic>– a bias making a current stimulus
  to appear more similar to a previous one – has been indeed shown to be ubiquitous
  in vision. At the neural level, serial dependence is accompanied by a signature
  of stimulus history (i.e., past stimulus information) emerging from early visual-evoked
  activity. However, whether this neural signature effectively reflects the behavioural
  bias is unclear. Here we address this question by assessing the neural (electrophysiological)
  and behavioural signature of stimulus history in human subjects (both male and female),
  in the context of numerosity, duration, and size perception. First, our results
  show that while the behavioural effect is task-dependent, its neural signature also
  reflects task-irrelevant dimensions of a past stimulus, suggesting a partial dissociation
  between the mechanisms mediating the encoding of stimulus history and the behavioural
  bias itself. Second, we show that performing a task is not a necessary condition
  to observe the neural signature of stimulus history, but that in the presence of
  an active task such a signature is significantly amplified. Finally, and more importantly,
  we show that the pattern of brain activity in a relatively early latency window
  (starting at ∼35-65 ms after stimulus onset) significantly predicts the behavioural
  effect. Overall, our results thus demonstrate that the encoding of past stimulus
  information in neural signals does indeed reflect serial dependence, and that serial
  dependence occurs at a relatively early level of visual processing.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SIGNIFICANCE
  STATEMENT:</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>What we perceive is determined not only by
  the information reaching our sensory organs, but also by the context in which the
  information is embedded in. What we saw in the recent past (perceptual history)
  can indeed modulate the perception of a current stimulus in an attractive way –
  a bias that is ubiquitous in vision. Here we show that this bias can be predicted
  by the pattern of brain activity reflecting the encoding of past stimulus information,
  very early after the onset of a stimulus. This in turn suggests that the integration
  of past and present sensory information mediating the attractive bias occurs early
  in the visual processing stream, and likely involves early visual cortices.</jats:p>
