abstract: Using tools from the representation theory of compact Lie groups, we formulate
  a theory of Barren Plateaus (BPs) for parameterized quantum circuits whose observables
  lie in their dynamical Lie algebra (DLA), a setting that we term Lie algebra Supported
  Ansatz (LASA). A large variety of commonly used ans\"atze such as the Hamiltonian
  Variational Ansatz, Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, and many equivariant quantum
  neural networks are LASAs. In particular, our theory provides for the first time
  the ability to compute the variance of the gradient of the cost function for a non-trivial,
  subspace uncontrollable family of quantum circuits, the quantum compound ans\"atze.
  We rigorously prove that the variance of the gradient of the cost function, under
  Haar initialization, scales inversely with the dimension of the DLA, which agrees
  with existing numerical observations. Lastly, we include potential extensions for
  handling cases when the observable lies outside of the DLA and the implications
  of our results.
