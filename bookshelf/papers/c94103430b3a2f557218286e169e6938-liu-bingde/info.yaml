abstract: The basic Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) problem is trying to maximize the rewards
  obtained from bandits with different unknown probability distributions of payoff
  for pulling different arms, given that only a finite number of attempts can be made.
  When studying trading algorithms in the market, we are looking at one of the most
  complex variants of MABs problems, namely the Non-stationary Continuum Bandits (NCBs)
  problem. The Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) is a simple simulation of an electronic
  financial exchange based on a continuous double auction running via a limit order
  book. The market can be populated by automated trader agents with different trading
  algorithms. Within them, the PRSH algorithm embodies some basic ideas for solving
  NCBs problems. However, it faces the difficulty to adjust hyperparameters and adapt
  to changes in complex market conditions. We propose a new algorithm called PRB,
  which solves Continuum Bandits problem by Bayesian optimization, and solves Non-stationary
  Bandits problem by a novel "bandit-over-bandit" framework. With BSE, we use as many
  kinds of trader agents as possible to simulate the real market environment under
  two different market dynamics. We then examine the optimal hyperparameters of the
  PRSH algorithm and the PRB algorithm under different market dynamics respectively.
  Finally, by having trader agents using both algorithms trade in the market at the
  same time, we demonstrate that the PRB algorithm has better performance than the
  PRSH algorithm under both market dynamics. In particular, we perform rigorous hypothesis
  testing on all experimental results to ensure their correctness.
