abstract: A major problem in blockchain-based supply chain management is the unclear
  validity of digital twins when dealing with digital representations of physical
  goods. Indeed, the use of blockchain technology to trace goods is ineffective if
  there is no strong correspondence between what is physically exchanged and the digital
  information that appears in blockchain transactions. In this work we propose a model
  for strengthening the supply chain management of physical goods leveraging blockchain
  technology through a digital-twin verification feature. Our model can be instantiated
  in various scenarios and we have in particular considered the popular case of food
  traceability. In contrast to weaker models known in the literature that propose
  their own ad-hoc properties to assess the robustness of their supply chain management
  systems, in this work we use the formalism of secure computation, where processes
  are described through generic and natural ideal functionalities.
