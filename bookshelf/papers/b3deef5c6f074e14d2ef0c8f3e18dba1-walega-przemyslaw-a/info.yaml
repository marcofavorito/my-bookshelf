abstract: '<jats:p>We study DatalogMTL—an extension of Datalog with metric temporal
  operators—under integer semantics, where the temporal domain of both interpretations
  and temporal operators consists of integer time points only. This is in contrast
  to the standard semantics, which is defined over the rational timeline. DatalogMTL
  under integer semantics is an interesting KR language: on the one hand, one can
  often assume the integer timeline in applications; on the other hand, it captures
  prominent temporal extensions of Datalog such as Datalog1S. We show that the choice
  of integer semantics leads to more favourable computational properties. We first
  show that reasoning over integers is at most as hard as reasoning over rationals
  for DatalogMTL and its natural fragments. Then, we investigate fragments of DatalogMTL
  where adopting the integer semantics makes reasoning easier. In particular, we show
  that complexity drops from P-hard to NC1-complete for the propositional fragment
  (where all object variables are grounded), and from TC0-hard to ACC0 for the linear
  fragment where the past diamond operator is the only metric operator allowed in
  rule bodies. Thus, reasoning in such fragments is both tractable and highly parallelisable,
  which suggests their appropriateness for data-intensive applications.</jats:p>'
