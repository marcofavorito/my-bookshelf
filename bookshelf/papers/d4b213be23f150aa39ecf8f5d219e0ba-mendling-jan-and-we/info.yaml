abstract: Blockchain technology promises a sizable potential for executing inter-organizational
  business processes without requiring a central party serving as a single point of
  trust (and failure). This paper analyzes its impact on business process management
  (BPM). We structure the discussion using two BPM frameworks, namely the six BPM
  core capabilities and the BPM lifecycle. This paper provides research directions
  for investigating the application of blockchain technology to BPM.
