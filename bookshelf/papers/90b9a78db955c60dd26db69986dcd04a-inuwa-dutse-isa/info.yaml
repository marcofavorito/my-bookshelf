abstract: 'One of the defining phenomena in this age is the widespread deployment
  of systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With AI taking the
  center stage, many sections of society are being affected directly or indirectly
  by algorithmic decisions. Algorithmic decisions carry both economical and personal
  implications which have brought about the issues of fairness, accountability, transparency
  and ethics (FATE) in AI geared towards addressing algorithmic disparities. Ethical
  AI deals with incorporating moral behaviour to avoid encoding bias in AI''s decisions.
  However, the present discourse on such critical issues is being shaped by the more
  economically developed countries (MEDC), which raises concerns regarding neglecting
  local knowledge, cultural pluralism and global fairness. This study builds upon
  existing research on responsible AI, with a focus on areas in the Global South considered
  to be under-served vis-a-vis AI. Our goal is two-fold (1) to assess FATE-related
  issues and the effectiveness of transparency methods and (2) to proffer useful insights
  and stimulate action towards bridging the accessibility and inclusivity gap in AI.
  Using ads data from online social networks, we designed a user study (n=43) to achieve
  the above goals. Among the findings from the study include: explanations about decisions
  reached by the AI systems tend to be vague and less informative. To bridge the accessibility
  and inclusivity gap, there is a need to engage with the community for the best way
  to integrate fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics in AI. This will
  help in empowering the affected community or individual to effectively probe and
  police the growing application of AI-powered systems.'
