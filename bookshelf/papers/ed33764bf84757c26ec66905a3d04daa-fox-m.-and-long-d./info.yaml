abstract: In recent years research in the planning community has moved increasingly
  toward s application of planners to realistic problems involving both time and many
  typ es of resources. For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space
  res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover
  ex ploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive
  domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also
  helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be
  confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application. The International
  Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating fo rce behind the progress
  that has been made in planning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002)
  set the planning community the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources.
  This necessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing
  temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the
  language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax of the
  language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe
  that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power --- exceeding the capabilities of
  current planning technology --- and presents a number of important challenges to
  the research community.
