abstract: As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question
  of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational
  task is attracting much attention. The leading candidate task for this milestone
  entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit.
  We develop a massively-parallel simulation tool Rollright that does not require
  inter-process communication (IPC) or proprietary hardware. We also develop two ways
  to trade circuit fidelity for computational speedups, so as to match the fidelity
  of a given quantum computer --- a task previously thought impossible. We report
  massive speedups for the sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM,
  Alibaba and Google, as well as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using
  publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable
  comparisons by total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling
  from the output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million
  bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5%, at an estimated cost of $35184. The
  simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate
  that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million dollars. Scaling
  the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for sampling 1M bitstrings
  helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We describe refinements in benchmarks
  that slow down leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated
  within the same time.
