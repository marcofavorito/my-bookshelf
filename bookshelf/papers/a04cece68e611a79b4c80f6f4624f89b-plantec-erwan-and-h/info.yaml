abstract: The design of complex self-organising systems producing life-like phenomena,
  such as the open-ended evolution of virtual creatures, is one of the main goals
  of artificial life. Lenia, a family of cellular automata (CA) generalizing Conway's
  Game of Life to continuous space, time and states, has attracted a lot of attention
  because of the wide diversity of self-organizing patterns it can generate. Among
  those, some spatially localized patterns (SLPs) resemble life-like artificial creatures
  and display complex behaviors. However, those creatures are found in only a small
  subspace of the Lenia parameter space and are not trivial to discover, necessitating
  advanced search algorithms. Furthermore, each of these creatures exist only in worlds
  governed by specific update rules and thus cannot interact in the same one. This
  paper proposes as mass-conservative extension of Lenia, called Flow Lenia, that
  solve both of these issues. We present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness
  in generating SLPs with complex behaviors and show that the update rule parameters
  can be optimized to generate SLPs showing behaviors of interest. Finally, we show
  that Flow Lenia enables the integration of the parameters of the CA update rules
  within the CA dynamics, making them dynamic and localized, allowing for multi-species
  simulations, with locally coherent update rules that define properties of the emerging
  creatures, and that can be mixed with neighbouring rules. We argue that this paves
  the way for the intrinsic evolution of self-organized artificial life forms within
  continuous CAs.
