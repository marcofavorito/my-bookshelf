abstract: 'Recent progress in large language models has enabled the deployment of
  many generative NLP applications. At the same time, it has also led to a misleading
  public discourse that ``it''s all been solved.'''' Not surprisingly, this has in
  turn made many NLP researchers -- especially those at the beginning of their career
  -- wonder about what NLP research area they should focus on. This document is a
  compilation of NLP research directions that are rich for exploration, reflecting
  the views of a diverse group of PhD students in an academic research lab. While
  we identify many research areas, many others exist; we do not cover those areas
  that are currently addressed by LLMs but where LLMs lag behind in performance, or
  those focused on LLM development. We welcome suggestions for other research directions
