abstract: We consider the compilation of a binary neural network's decision function
  into tractable representations such as Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs)
  and Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs). Obtaining this function as an OBDD/SDD
  facilitates the explanation and formal verification of a neural network's behavior.
  First, we consider the task of verifying the robustness of a neural network, and
  show how we can compute the expected robustness of a neural network, given an OBDD/SDD
  representation of it. Next, we consider a more efficient approach for compiling
  neural networks, based on a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for compiling a neuron.
  We then provide a case study in a handwritten digits dataset, highlighting how two
  neural networks trained from the same dataset can have very high accuracies, yet
  have very different levels of robustness. Finally, in experiments, we show that
  it is feasible to obtain compact representations of neural networks as SDDs.
