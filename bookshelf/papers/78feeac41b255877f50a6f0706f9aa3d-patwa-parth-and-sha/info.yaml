abstract: 'Along with COVID-19 pandemic we are also fighting an `infodemic''. Fake
  news and rumors are rampant on social media. Believing in rumors can cause significant
  harm. This is further exacerbated at the time of a pandemic. To tackle this, we
  curate and release a manually annotated dataset of 10,700 social media posts and
  articles of real and fake news on COVID-19. We benchmark the annotated dataset with
  four machine learning baselines - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost,
  and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We obtain the best performance of 93.46% F1-score
  with SVM. The data and code is available at: https://github.com/parthpatwa/covid19-fake-news-dectection'
