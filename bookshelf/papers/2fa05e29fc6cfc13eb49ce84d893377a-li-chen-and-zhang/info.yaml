abstract: Human motion modeling is a classic problem in computer vision and graphics.
  Challenges in modeling human motion include high dimensional prediction as well
  as extremely complicated dynamics.We present a novel approach to human motion modeling
  based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The hierarchical structure of CNN
  makes it capable of capturing both spatial and temporal correlations effectively.
  In our proposed approach,a convolutional long-term encoder is used to encode the
  whole given motion sequence into a long-term hidden variable, which is used with
  a decoder to predict the remainder of the sequence. The decoder itself also has
  an encoder-decoder structure, in which the short-term encoder encodes a shorter
  sequence to a short-term hidden variable, and the spatial decoder maps the long
  and short-term hidden variable to motion predictions. By using such a model, we
  are able to capture both invariant and dynamic information of human motion, which
  results in more accurate predictions. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods on the Human3.6M and CMU Motion Capture datasets. Our
  code is available at the project website.
