abstract: 'Modelling human function learning has been the subject of in-tense research
  in cognitive sciences. The topic is relevant in black-box optimization where information
  about the objective and/or constraints is not available and must be learned through
  function evaluations. In this paper we focus on the relation between the behaviour
  of humans searching for the maximum and the probabilistic model used in Bayesian
  Optimization. As surrogate models of the unknown function both Gaussian Processes
  and Random Forest have been considered: the Bayesian learning paradigm is central
  in the development of active learning approaches balancing exploration/exploitation
  in uncertain conditions towards effective generalization in large decision spaces.
  In this paper we analyse experimentally how Bayesian Optimization compares to humans
  searching for the maximum of an unknown 2D function. A set of controlled experiments
  with 60 subjects, using both surrogate models, confirm that Bayesian Optimization
  provides a general model to represent individual patterns of active learning in
  humans'
