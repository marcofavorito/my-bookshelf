abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in
  building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from
  using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition,
  video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans
  in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements,
  these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress
  in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines
  will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and
  how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal
  models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely
  solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories
  of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned;
  and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize
  knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising
  routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network
  advances with more structured cognitive models.
