abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to a growing interest
  in applying RL to classical planning domains or applying classical planning methods
  to some complex RL domains. However, the long-horizon goal-based problems found
  in classical planning lead to sparse rewards for RL, making direct application inefficient.
  In this paper, we propose to leverage domain-independent heuristic functions commonly
  used in the classical planning literature to improve the sample efficiency of RL.
  These classical heuristics act as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards
  issue and enable our RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals
  on these heuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique
  requires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted metric
  used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic Machines,
  a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic inputs. We
  demonstrate on several classical planning domains that using classical heuristics
  for RL allows for good sample efficiency compared to sparse-reward RL. We further
  show that our learned value functions generalize to novel problem instances in the
  same domain.
