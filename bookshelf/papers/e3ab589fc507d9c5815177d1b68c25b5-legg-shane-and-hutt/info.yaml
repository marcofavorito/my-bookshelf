abstract: This paper is a survey of a large number of informal definitions of ``intelligence''
  that the authors have collected over the years. Naturally, compiling a complete
  list would be impossible as many definitions of intelligence are buried deep inside
  articles and books. Nevertheless, the 70-odd definitions presented here are, to
  the authors' knowledge, the largest and most well referenced collection there is.
