abstract: 'The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental
  issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The
  deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal
  languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for
  reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from
  examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these
  camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over
  areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level
  control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps
  even ill-formed. In this article, we survey work that provides further evidence
  for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms
  of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for
  machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an emphasis
  on the following "sore" point: there is a common misconception that logic is for
  discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine learning, more generally,
  is for continuous properties. We report on results that challenge this view on the
  limitations of logic, and expose the role that logic can play for learning in infinite
  domains.'
