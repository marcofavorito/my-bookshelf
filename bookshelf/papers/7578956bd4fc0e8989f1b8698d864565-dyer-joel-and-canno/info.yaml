abstract: Calibrating agent-based models (ABMs) to data is among the most fundamental
  requirements to ensure the model fulfils its desired purpose. In recent years, simulation-based
  inference methods have emerged as powerful tools for performing this task when the
  model likelihood function is intractable, as is often the case for ABMs. In some
  real-world use cases of ABMs, both the observed data and the ABM output consist
  of the agents' states and their interactions over time. In such cases, there is
  a tension between the desire to make full use of the rich information content of
  such granular data on the one hand, and the need to reduce the dimensionality of
  the data to prevent difficulties associated with high-dimensional learning tasks
  on the other. A possible resolution is to construct lower-dimensional time-series
  through the use of summary statistics describing the macrostate of the system at
  each time point. However, a poor choice of summary statistics can result in an unacceptable
  loss of information from the original dataset, dramatically reducing the quality
  of the resulting calibration. In this work, we instead propose to learn parameter
  posteriors associated with granular microdata directly using temporal graph neural
  networks. We will demonstrate that such an approach offers highly compelling inductive
  biases for Bayesian inference using the raw ABM microstates as output.
