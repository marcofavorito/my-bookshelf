abstract: <jats:p>With the popularity of Bitcoin, there is a growing need to understand
  the functionality, security, and performance of various mechanisms that comprise
  it. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin’s scripting language, Script, that is one
  of the main building blocks of Bitcoin transactions. We formally define the semantics
  of Script, and study the problem of determining whether a user-defined script is
  well-formed; that is, whether it can be unlocked, or whether it contains errors
  that would prevent this from happening.</jats:p>
