abstract: In many areas of the observational and experimental sciences data is scarce.
  Data observation in high-energy astrophysics is disrupted by celestial occlusions
  and limited telescope time while data derived from laboratory experiments in synthetic
  chemistry and materials science is time and cost-intensive to collect. On the other
  hand, knowledge about the data-generation mechanism is often available in the sciences,
  such as the measurement error of a piece of laboratory apparatus. Both characteristics,
  small data and knowledge of the underlying physics, make Gaussian processes (GPs)
  ideal candidates for fitting such datasets. GPs can make predictions with consideration
  of uncertainty, for example in the virtual screening of molecules and materials,
  and can also make inferences about incomplete data such as the latent emission signature
  from a black hole accretion disc. Furthermore, GPs are currently the workhorse model
  for Bayesian optimisation, a methodology foreseen to be a guide for laboratory experiments
  in scientific discovery campaigns. The first contribution of this thesis is to use
  GP modelling to reason about the latent emission signature from the Seyfert galaxy
  Markarian 335, and by extension, to reason about the applicability of various theoretical
  models of black hole accretion discs. The second contribution is to extend the GP
  framework to molecular and chemical reaction representations and to provide an open-source
  software library to enable the framework to be used by scientists. The third contribution
  is to leverage GPs to discover novel and performant photoswitch molecules. The fourth
  contribution is to introduce a Bayesian optimisation scheme capable of modelling
  aleatoric uncertainty to facilitate the identification of material compositions
  that possess intrinsic robustness to large scale fabrication processes.
