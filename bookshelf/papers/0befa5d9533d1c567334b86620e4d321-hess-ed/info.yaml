abstract: To date, many of us have achieved success by being “smarter” than other
  people as measured by grades and test scores, beginning from our early days in school.
  The smart people were those that received the highest scores by making the fewest
  mistakes. AI will change that because there is no way any human being can outsmart,
  for example, IBM’s Watson, at least without augmentation. What is needed is a new
  definition of “being smart,” one that promotes higher levels of human thinking and
  emotional engagement.
