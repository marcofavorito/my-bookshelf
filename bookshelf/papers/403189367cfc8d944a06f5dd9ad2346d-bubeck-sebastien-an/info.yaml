abstract: 'We prove a few new lower bounds on the randomized competitive ratio for
  the $k$-server problem and other related problems, resolving some long-standing
  conjectures. In particular, for metrical task systems (MTS) we asympotically settle
  the competitive ratio and obtain the first improvement to an existential lower bound
  since the introduction of the model 35 years ago (in 1987).   More concretely, we
  show:   1. There exist $(k+1)$-point metric spaces in which the randomized competitive
  ratio for the $k$-server problem is $\Omega(\log^2 k)$. This refutes the folklore
  conjecture (which is known to hold in some families of metrics) that in all metric
  spaces with at least $k+1$ points, the competitive ratio is $\Theta(\log k)$.   2.
  Consequently, there exist $n$-point metric spaces in which the randomized competitive
  ratio for MTS is $\Omega(\log^2 n)$. This matches the upper bound that holds for
  all metrics. The previously best existential lower bound was $\Omega(\log n)$ (which
  was known to be tight for some families of metrics).   3. For all $k<n\in\mathbb
  N$, for *all* $n$-point metric spaces the randomized $k$-server competitive ratio
  is at least $\Omega(\log k)$, and consequently the randomized MTS competitive ratio
  is at least $\Omega(\log n)$. These universal lower bounds are asymptotically tight.
  The previous bounds were $\Omega(\log k/\log\log k)$ and $\Omega(\log n/\log \log
  n)$, respectively.   4. The randomized competitive ratio for the $w$-set metrical
  service systems problem, and its equivalent width-$w$ layered graph traversal problem,
  is $\Omega(w^2)$. This slightly improves the previous lower bound and matches the
  recently discovered upper bound.   5. Our results imply improved lower bounds for
  other problems like $k$-taxi, distributed paging and metric allocation.   These
  lower bounds share a common thread, and other than the third bound, also a common
  construction.'
