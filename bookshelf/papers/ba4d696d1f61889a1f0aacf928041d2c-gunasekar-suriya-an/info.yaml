abstract: 'We introduce phi-1, a new large language model for code, with significantly
  smaller size than competing models: phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B
  parameters, trained for 4 days on 8 A100s, using a selection of ``textbook quality"
  data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically generated textbooks and exercises
  with GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy
  50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent properties
  compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding
  exercises, and phi-1-small, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the
  same pipeline as phi-1 that still achieves 45% on HumanEval.'
