abstract: 'Interpretability in machine learning (ML) is crucial for high stakes decisions
  and troubleshooting. In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable
  ML, and dispel common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial
  topic. We also identify 10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning
  and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically
  important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years.
  These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees;
  (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive
  models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based
  reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete
  supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised
  disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization;
  (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or
  causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the "Rashomon set" of good models; and
  (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning. This survey is suitable as a starting
  point for statisticians and computer scientists interested in working in interpretable
  machine learning.'
