abstract: Reinforcement learning has a rich history in neuroscience, from early work
  on dopamine as a reward prediction error signal for temporal difference learning
  (Schultz et al., 1997) to recent work suggesting that dopamine could implement a
  form of 'distributional reinforcement learning' popularized in deep learning (Dabney
  et al., 2020). Throughout this literature, there has been a tight link between theoretical
  advances in reinforcement learning and neuroscientific experiments and findings.
  As a result, the theories describing our experimental data have become increasingly
  complex and difficult to navigate. In this review, we cover the basic theory underlying
  classical work in reinforcement learning and build up to an introductory overview
  of methods used in modern deep reinforcement learning that have found applications
  in systems neuroscience. We start with an overview of the reinforcement learning
  problem and classical temporal difference algorithms, followed by a discussion of
  'model-free' and 'model-based' reinforcement learning together with methods such
  as DYNA and successor representations that fall in between these two categories.
  Throughout these sections, we highlight the close parallels between the machine
  learning methods and related work in both experimental and theoretical neuroscience.
  We then provide an introduction to deep reinforcement learning with examples of
  how these methods have been used to model different learning phenomena in the systems
  neuroscience literature, such as meta-reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2018)
  and distributional reinforcement learning (Dabney et al., 2020). Code that implements
  the methods discussed in this work and generates the figures is also provided.
