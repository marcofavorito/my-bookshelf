abstract: Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible
  with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions
  of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but
  developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised
  and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed
  to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out
  of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point
  of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so
  long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective
  function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea
  is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate
  rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution
  of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the
  above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only
  requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning
  to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic
  interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the
  generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these
  ideas on generative learning tasks.
