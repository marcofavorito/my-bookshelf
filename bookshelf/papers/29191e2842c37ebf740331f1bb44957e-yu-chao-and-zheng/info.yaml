abstract: Reinforcement Learning(RL) has achieved tremendous development in recent
  years, but still faces significant obstacles in addressing complex real-life problems
  due to the issues of poor system generalization, low sample efficiency as well as
  safety and interpretability concerns. The core reason underlying such dilemmas can
  be attributed to the fact that most of the work has focused on the computational
  aspect of value functions or policies using a representational model to describe
  atomic components of rewards, states and actions etc, thus neglecting the rich high-level
  declarative domain knowledge of facts, relations and rules that can be either provided
  a priori or acquired through reasoning over time. Recently, there has been a rapidly
  growing interest in the use of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning(KRR) methods,
  usually using logical languages, to enable more abstract representation and efficient
  learning in RL. In this survey, we provide a preliminary overview on these endeavors
  that leverage the strengths of KRR to help solving various problems in RL, and discuss
  the challenging open problems and possible directions for future work in this area.
