abstract: The ICT (Information Communication Technologies) ecosystem is estimated
  to be responsible, as of today, for 10% of the total worldwide energy demand - equivalent
  to the combined energy production of Germany and Japan. Cloud storage, mainly operated
  through large and densely-packed data centers, constitutes a non-negligible part
  of it. However, since the cloud is a fast-inflating market and the energy-efficiency
  of data centers is mostly an insensitive issue for the collectivity, its carbon
  footprint shows no signs of slowing down. In this paper, we analyze a novel paradigm
  for cloud storage (implemented by Cubbit, http://cubbit.io), in which data are stored
  and distributed over a network of p2p-interacting ARM-based single-board devices.
  We compare Cubbit's distributed cloud to the traditional centralized solution in
  terms of environmental footprint and energy efficiency. We demonstrate that, compared
  to the centralized cloud, the distributed architecture of Cubbit has a carbon footprint
  reduced of a 77% factor for data storage and of a 50% factor for data transfers.
  These results provide an example of how a radical paradigm shift in a large-reach
  technology can benefit both the final consumer as well as our society as a whole.
