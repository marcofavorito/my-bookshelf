abstract: We present MM-Navigator, a GPT-4V-based agent for the smartphone graphical
  user interface (GUI) navigation task. MM-Navigator can interact with a smartphone
  screen as human users, and determine subsequent actions to fulfill given instructions.
  Our findings demonstrate that large multimodal models (LMMs), specifically GPT-4V,
  excel in zero-shot GUI navigation through its advanced screen interpretation, action
  reasoning, and precise action localization capabilities. We first benchmark MM-Navigator
  on our collected iOS screen dataset. According to human assessments, the system
  exhibited a 91\% accuracy rate in generating reasonable action descriptions and
  a 75\% accuracy rate in executing the correct actions for single-step instructions
  on iOS. Additionally, we evaluate the model on a subset of an Android screen navigation
  dataset, where the model outperforms previous GUI navigators in a zero-shot fashion.
  Our benchmark and detailed analyses aim to lay a robust groundwork for future research
  into the GUI navigation task. The project page is at https://github.com/zzxslp/MM-Navigator.
