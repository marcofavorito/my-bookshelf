abstract: 'Introduction: In contrast to current AI technology, natural intelligence
  -- the kind of autonomous intelligence that is realized in the brains of animals
  and humans to attain in their natural environment goals defined by a repertoire
  of innate behavioral schemata -- is far superior in terms of learning speed, generalization
  capabilities, autonomy and creativity. How are these strengths, by what means are
  ideas and imagination produced in natural neural networks?   Methods: Reviewing
  the literature, we put forward the argument that both our natural environment and
  the brain are of low complexity, that is, require for their generation very little
  information and are consequently both highly structured. We further argue that the
  structures of brain and natural environment are closely related.   Results: We propose
  that the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organized
  network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables
  the brain to learn quickly, generalize from few examples and bridge the gap between
  abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations.   Conclusions: Our results
  have important bearings on open problems in artificial neural network research.'
