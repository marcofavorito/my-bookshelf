abstract: 'In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs,
  coupled with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a
  hurdle for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
  Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
  using microbenchmarks.   The introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s latest
  architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine Turing
  and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations. Specifically,
  we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications. We describe
  its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the P4 GPU based on
  the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly higher frequency-per-Watt
  figures than their full-size counterparts.   We study the performance of the T4''s
  TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on low-precision operands than on
  the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces new instructions that express matrix
  math more succinctly. We map Turing''s instruction space, finding the same encoding
  as Volta, and additional instructions. We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has
  the same memory hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104
  are frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each
  constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance
  improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
  workloads that hit power or thermal limits.   Many of our findings are novel, published
  here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software developers
  get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.'
