abstract: Despite its great importance, modern network infrastructure is remarkable
  for the lack of rigor in its engineering. The Internet which began as a research
  experiment was never designed to handle the users and applications it hosts today.
  The lack of formalization of the Internet architecture meant limited abstractions
  and modularity, especially for the control and management planes, thus requiring
  for every new need a new protocol built from scratch. This led to an unwieldy ossified
  Internet architecture resistant to any attempts at formal verification, and an Internet
  culture where expediency and pragmatism are favored over formal correctness. Fortunately,
  recent work in the space of clean slate Internet design---especially, the software
  defined networking (SDN) paradigm---offers the Internet community another chance
  to develop the right kind of architecture and abstractions. This has also led to
  a great resurgence in interest of applying formal methods to specification, verification,
  and synthesis of networking protocols and applications. In this paper, we present
  a self-contained tutorial of the formidable amount of work that has been done in
  formal methods, and present a survey of its applications to networking.
