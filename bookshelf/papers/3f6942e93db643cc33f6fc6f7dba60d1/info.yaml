abstract: 'The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative
  research The Turing Way December 2022 Latest The Turing Way is an open source community-driven
  guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science. The Turing
  Way book is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners,
  educators, and other stakeholders. The Turing Way project is openly developed and
  any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository:
  https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. In 2020, the project underwent
  a major overhaul categorising chapters into 5 guides on reproducible research, project
  design, collaboration, communication and ethical research. Additionally, we added
  a community handbook to document all the practices designed and implemented towards
  the development of the project and community. This release in 2021 includes additional
  chapters developed by our contributors across five guides and the community handbook.
  In addition, all the project documents from the project are provided as they appear
  on The Turing Way GitHub repository including the Zenodo metadata: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
