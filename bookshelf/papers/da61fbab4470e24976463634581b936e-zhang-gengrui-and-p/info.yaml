abstract: Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms are at the core of providing
  safety and liveness guarantees for distributed systems that must operate in the
  presence of arbitrary failures. Recently, numerous new BFT algorithms have been
  proposed, not least due to the traction blockchain technologies have garnered in
  the search for consensus solutions that offer high throughput, low latency, and
  robust system designs. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of selected
  and distinguished BFT algorithms that have received extensive attention in academia
  and industry alike. We perform a qualitative comparison among all algorithms we
  review considering message and time complexities. Furthermore, we decompose each
  consensus algorithm into its constituent subprotocols for replication and view change
  backed by intuitive figures to illustrate the message-passing pattern. We also elaborate
  on the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art
  approaches.
